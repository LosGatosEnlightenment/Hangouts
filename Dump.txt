08-28 21:15 <Christy King> Howdy
08-28 21:15 <Brian Wiebe> Heelo
08-28 21:15 <Zach Crawford> Hello
08-28 21:15 <Josh Lehan> Hi!
08-28 21:15 <Brian Wiebe> Hello*
08-28 21:50 <Christy King> Oh that looks goooood!
08-28 21:59 <Zach Crawford> We just fielded over simples house
08-28 21:59 <Zach Crawford> Going to Erik's
08-28 21:59 <Brian Wiebe> Nice!
08-28 22:01 <Brian Wiebe> Weller you there
08-28 22:01 <Brian Wiebe> We'll *
08-28 23:28 <Christy King> Psst! We all made top 50!!
08-28 23:28 <Zach Crawford> Nice!
08-28 23:29 <Zach Crawford> I hit 11
08-29 00:16 <Christy King> Well done! We'll all do this again soon. :-)
08-29 00:22 <Zach Crawford> Holy crap! I'm #7!
08-29 00:56 <Josh Lehan> Yay that is great - had fun
08-31 19:24 <Christy King> Our portal at Erik's still stands! =D
08-31 19:26 <Christy King> But Marjorie needs help, if anyone's in the area. She's blue with links and fields!
08-31 19:27 <Josh Lehan> Nice
08-31 19:27 <Josh Lehan> Good to keep this hangout open
08-31 19:27 <Christy King> Yup. We can make this the Team Los Gatos planning zone, hehe.
08-31 19:29 <Josh Lehan> Seeker's real name is ########. He attempted to contact me on Hangouts and said he would report me for being in the park late. Meh.
08-31 19:43 <Josh Lehan> It is green versus blue at the park tonight :)
08-31 19:43 <Josh Lehan> ####
08-31 20:16 <Josh Lehan> Effective: I am totally out of XMP now but cleared every blue field from the park!
08-31 20:17 <Brian Wiebe> Nice Josh!
08-31 20:18 <Josh Lehan> Thanks!
08-31 20:45 <Christy King> Awesome!! How the hell did he get your g+ account??
08-31 20:45 <Josh Lehan> I have it in my Ingress profile :) and I am not hard to find online
08-31 20:47 <Christy King> I reported him for waiting for me at the trailhead, and also mentioned he keeps threatening to report people for leaving a park as it closes as "tresspassing"
08-31 20:47 <Christy King> I thought only your team could see your g+ in your profile.
08-31 20:48 <Brian Wiebe> That's one reason I hadn't added my agent name to my g+ name
08-31 20:59:27 *** Christy King changed conversation name to 'Team Los Gatos!'
08-31 21:00 <Zach Crawford> I just saw all of these messages, blowing up the park, that is awesome. 
08-31 21:07 <Zach Crawford> I would love to tell simple seeker to calm down, it's just a game but that never turns out well. Ignoring him online and being generally pleasant in person is typically the best policy. 
08-31 21:08 <Christy King> Yeah... and he'll just block you anyways:-)
08-31 21:08 <Brian Wiebe> Ya. That was my plan too. Also just keep taking the area back. Cause that's how you play the game
08-31 21:08 <Christy King> And probably cover his ears and sing "lalalalala"
08-31 21:09 <Zach Crawford> Yup, if he starts contacting me I'll just block him as well
08-31 21:10 <Zach Crawford> Then field over JCC 
08-31 21:10 <Brian Wiebe> Hahahaha
08-31 21:10 <Christy King> He does seem to have a personal vendetta against me. We went out to the Perculation Ponds, which weren't even his, but he was there immediately after. Soooo... next time you want to field over my house, I'll hack something random first and distract him away from there
08-31 21:10 <Christy King> Hahaha, exaaaaaactly!
08-31 21:11 <Christy King> Link from Perculation Ponds or farther, so it takes him awhile hehe
08-31 21:11 <Zach Crawford> I would like to make it a little harder for him.  Get the portals farther away from him that will cover the area. Make him drive a little. 
08-31 21:12 <Brian Wiebe> Yep., then as he takes it down, be ready and field for a completely opposite direction =p
08-31 21:14 <Zach Crawford> Lol, nice
08-31 21:14 <Christy King> Ohhh, YESSSS!  Start with close-ish  (per ponds are closed at night, so would he tresspass??) And then when he's scrambling to destroy, 5 new fields all with different points!!
08-31 21:15 <Christy King> He'd crap.himself with fury!
08-31 21:15 <Brian Wiebe> Rofl!!!!!
08-31 21:16 <Christy King> I don't know how that's a link, but I do NOT want to see that website!!! XD
08-31 21:25 <Christy King> Their whole family is at Good Will right now, deploying on it!
08-31 21:25 <Christy King> Is anyone nearby that wants to crash the party??
08-31 21:25 <Zach Crawford> Sorry, already home. 
08-31 21:26 <Christy King> Me too =(
08-31 21:26 <Brian Wiebe> Me three =(
08-31 21:27 <Brian Wiebe> But if I get off early tomorrow after I'm back from Folsom I'll swing down there.
08-31 21:27 <Brian Wiebe> I can also pass some gear off to you Josh if you like.
08-31 21:28 <Christy King> I'll be done with work at 5:30 and plan to hit up Circle Lot, and now this.
08-31 21:36 <Josh Lehan> Seeker told me his wife took a picture of my car as it left JCC slightly after it closed. Somewhat creepy.
08-31 21:36 <Josh Lehan> Wow lots of messages! Was driving, could not read.
08-31 21:37 <Zach Crawford> Isn't that against game rules?
08-31 21:37 <Christy King> That sounds like s violation of your privacy to me...
08-31 21:37 <Christy King> I would report them both.
08-31 21:37 <Zach Crawford> Did he type that to you or tell it to you?
08-31 21:37 <Josh Lehan> Told me in Hangouts
08-31 21:38 <Zach Crawford> Did you screen cap that?
08-31 21:38 <Christy King> Scrrenshot!
08-31 21:40 <Josh Lehan> ###
08-31 21:41 <Josh Lehan> ###
08-31 21:41 <Josh Lehan> ###
08-31 21:41 <Josh Lehan> There, took a while to find screenshots
08-31 21:42 <Christy King> That photo of his face looks about right...
08-31 21:43 <Josh Lehan> His face looks like the Open All glyph
08-31 21:43 <Christy King> Aahahahahaha!
08-31 21:43 <Zach Crawford> I wonder how many reports Niantic receives from him. 
08-31 21:44 <Christy King> I am pretty certain the rules state you can't follow people. He is very definitely doing that.
08-31 21:44 <Josh Lehan> Probably a crapton - wonder if Niantic has an anti-tattletale policy where they discount excessive reports from one
08-31 21:44 <Christy King> We should have taken a pic if him lurking at eriks! Although then we're at his level.
08-31 21:46 <Christy King> I mentioned the lurking and photo taking in my report, and that it makes me feel unsafe as a female, and less likely to recruit. I hope they read it.
08-31 21:47 <Christy King> Yeah, I bet they have bets on how many reports they get from him (and about him) each day. Or a drinking game. Every time, they all take a shot!
09-01 14:35 <Zach Crawford> Found a portal with 4 Axa's on it from SS and JA. Can't resist. Must take
09-01 14:42 <Josh Lehan> Nice! Where at? I am at Maggie tree now. 
09-01 15:56 <Christy King> Where's Maggie tree?
09-01 15:57 <Christy King> Oh haha, Majorie, nm. I had to add that to my phone's vocab. =P
09-01 15:57 <Christy King> I can grab Circle Lot after work.
09-01 16:06 <Zach Crawford> It was the goodwill truck at lark and Winchester. It was so nice killing all of those Axa's 
09-01 16:24 <Christy King> Oooh yes they love that truck. You can get Cryptoc, Dracolich, and the 2 at Creekside park when you're over there. They're all close together.
09-01 16:24 <Josh Lehan> Nice. I have not been to that area in a while. 
09-01 16:25 <Christy King> Oh right, that's where they all were last night!
09-01 17:28 <Christy King> It's confirmed they hang our with Waggamamma. JA and Wag just took out Eriks together. =(
09-01 19:18 <Josh Lehan> I am going to go to downtown Los Altos tonight to get gear
09-01 19:20 <Christy King> Nice!
09-01 19:23 <Christy King> I'm gonna call it a day for LG as well. They will probably go after "oak meadow" on peppertree. If you have a key, please help defend!
09-02 12:19 <Christy King> Brian wants to hit up LG tonight, and I'll be around. Josh, you're not here on Wednesdays right? =(  Zachary, you around?
09-02 12:19 <Josh Lehan> Correct, I'm near Oakland on Wednesdays
09-02 12:20 <Christy King> Also, we met Rohit in Milpitas, who glyph hacks like a CHAMP and usually has hundreds of L8 resos to give away. He said to spread the word. So if you want L8's... =)
09-02 12:21 <Josh Lehan> Nice! DTLA build successful last night, also encore Stanford smash
09-03 10:15 <Zach Crawford> Vasona looks great! Can I give you all of my Erik's keys to link back?
09-03 10:56 <Christy King> Sure, or I can give you some Vasona keys to link to. Brian and I won't be around much tonight, but if I swing by Eriks for lunch, maybe I could do a little linking after work.
09-03 10:57 <Christy King> I've got my coworker, Meltastic, in the game now too, so she's been helping green up around YSI. =)
09-03 13:11 <Josh Lehan> Nice! 
09-03 13:13 <Christy King> @Zach, I'm gonna head to Eriks in a minute. Let me know if you're around or just swing by there in 10. =)
09-03 18:14 <Christy King> Josh, you working out at jcc tonight? Lots of fields from that area ...
09-03 18:31 <Josh Lehan> Unfortunately no - pinball night tonight and I leave soon for that 
09-03 18:31 <Josh Lehan> The good news is that I am farmed and geared up again :) 
09-04 08:08 <Christy King> Anyone up to retake the park with me tonight? =)
09-04 10:31 <Zach Crawford> Looks like there's a level 3 enl player by the name of Meltastic at the YSI. Do you know if they are a regular or just visiting? 
09-04 10:31 <Zach Crawford> I have to cook dinner for Grandma tonight so I can't I wish I could but Grandma's gotta eat!
09-04 10:32 <Christy King> She's my coworker. I got her playing. =)
09-04 10:32 <Zach Crawford> I do have 15+ keys to Erik's Deli that I will gladly drop in a capsule for you. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help her out. 
09-04 10:32 <Christy King> No problem! Feel free to knock out a field at jcc on your way though!!
09-04 10:33 <Christy King> I would love those keys!! Is it green again?
09-04 10:33 <Zach Crawford> I used my last XMP taking back Erik's this morning. Gotta farm this weekend
09-04 10:33 <Zach Crawford> Yes, green with an AXA and a very rare multihack
09-04 10:37 <Christy King> Brian and I know someone in Mtn View always looking to get rid of level 8 resos... by the hundreds! Let us know if either of you are ever going to Mtn view and we'll connect you.
09-04 11:29 <Josh Lehan> Hi again all - I might be available for something tonight 
09-04 11:48 <Christy King> Excellent!  I'll be off work around 5:30 and then available until around 8, maybe 8:30.
09-04 18:34 <Christy King> @Josh, we're about to take out their portals at the Perculation Ponds and then legacy. They will be delightfully distracted if you want to attack maybe Oak Meadow. :-)
09-04 18:50 <Josh Lehan> Cool will do - sorry work got busy at end
09-04 18:51 <Christy King> No worries! We just did perc ponds... Now for the fun part!!!
09-04 18:56 <Christy King> Where you at?
09-04 19:08 <Josh Lehan> Near oak meadow now
09-04 19:18 <Christy King> Brian is heading that way too
09-04 19:18 <Christy King> From within the park
09-04 19:42 <Christy King> Can you guys link home with on the flow to sunset piano?
09-04 19:42 <Josh Lehan> Did it
09-04 19:42 <Christy King> Where you at?
09-04 19:43 <Brian Wiebe> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.236642,-121.9739837

09-04 19:46 <Christy King> (In case you didn't see the fields hehe)
09-04 19:47 <Christy King> Josh I'm heading your way next / to pier.
09-04 19:47 <Josh Lehan> Nice. At Creekside and will exit park via oak meadow playground.
09-04 19:47 <Christy King> Oh I thought you were at Vasona playground, never mind
09-04 19:48 <Josh Lehan> Would have gone there but got keyscrewed and could not make more fields
09-04 19:48 <Josh Lehan> Cashed in some good keys though for fields
09-04 19:48 <Christy King> Which keys?
09-04 19:48 <Christy King> I might have
09-04 19:49 <Josh Lehan> Feel free to throw more
09-04 19:49 <Josh Lehan> Wanted to maximize interior fields before darkness
09-04 20:17 <Josh Lehan> Oh to have a key for Oak Meadow Park Sign! Close huge diamond from Vasona entrance if possible.
09-04 21:07:31 *** Josh Lehan added user 'Justin Kominar' to conversation
09-04 21:07 <Josh Lehan> Hello, did it work?
09-04 21:07 <Josh Lehan> Seeker sighting at JCC
09-04 21:07 <Justin Kominar> Success!
09-04 21:08 <Christy King> Hi! I'm Seakay. :-)
09-04 21:09 <Justin Kominar> Howdy
09-04 21:09 <Josh Lehan> I can redeem low level rsonators for 500 AP all night
09-04 21:10 <Christy King> @Josh did you take the fields out? =))))
09-04 21:10 <Josh Lehan> Not yet
09-04 21:12 <Justin Kominar> Christy, do you live around here or just play around here?
09-04 21:12 <Christy King> I work in Vasona
09-04 21:12 <Justin Kominar> Oh, awesome
09-04 21:13 <Justin Kominar> As the science place?
09-04 21:13 <Christy King> And Brian (BW13B3) is my husband
09-04 21:13 <Christy King> Yeah! You've actually heard of it?!
09-04 21:14 <Justin Kominar> I have 2 little ones, so I was looking at the summer programs there at one point./
09-04 21:14 <Justin Kominar> Also, I've been by all the portals in the park  ;)
09-04 21:14 <Christy King> Cool!
09-04 21:15 <Christy King> The summer program is really good. You can also stop by most days and we'll pull an animal out for the kiddos to meet. :-)
09-04 21:16 <Justin Kominar> I work with the local scout pack 502 and the scouting season is about to fire back up ... maybe we'll have to talk about arranging a visit with the group sometime!
09-04 21:17 <Josh Lehan> Seeker is anyoyed that we were in park ha
09-04 21:17 <Christy King> Totally! I'm the one that schedules group programs, so call and ask for me. =)
09-04 21:17 <Christy King> @Josh If we didn't annoy him, we didn't succeed, haha.
09-04 21:18 <Justin Kominar> Seeker has been intentionally laying low lately, he told me.
09-04 21:18 <Justin Kominar> But I'm sure our presence annoys him nonetheless.
09-04 21:18 <Christy King> You know him??
09-04 21:18 <Justin Kominar> We've met on the field of battle a few times
09-04 21:19 <Justin Kominar> He lives right across from the JCC, as you may have surmised... so he popped out and had a chat with me one morning when I was having a particularly hard time popping an AXA he had on there  ;)
09-04 21:19 <Justin Kominar> So he jarvised his portal just to piss me off.
09-04 21:19 <Christy King> That guy is a creeper. He waited for me at a trailhead once! Aah!!  I wonder why he's laying low.
09-04 21:19 <Brian Wiebe> Ya we like making green fields intentionally over his house
09-04 21:20 <Justin Kominar> His entire family plays..  wife and 2 kids.  
09-04 21:20 <Justin Kominar> jennyappleseed, otherpeople and someother-seeker-name that's escaping me at the moment
09-04 21:21 <Josh Lehan> He seemed rather annoyed that I was snarky when I told him I had permission to be in there
09-04 21:22 <Josh Lehan> And envious that we were talking to the rangers and not getting thrown out :)
09-04 21:22 <Josh Lehan> I said only that and gave no further details
09-04 21:22 <Justin Kominar> ha
09-04 21:22 <Justin Kominar> yeah, he's been tolerable with me, but I've heard lots of stories of him being a dumbass to other players
09-04 21:23 <Christy King> YUP
09-04 22:09 <Josh Lehan> He kept attacking when I cleared JCC portal and I kept throwing down low level resos for 625 AP each
09-04 22:09 <Josh Lehan> It was strange, kind of a waste of XMP i would think
09-04 22:10 <Josh Lehan> I capture, he fires, repeat
09-04 22:11 <Zach Crawford> Sweet move!
09-04 22:13 <Josh Lehan> Wow JennyApplesauce accused me in COMM of watching her? Strange. They tend to be the ones stalking
09-04 22:14 <Zach Crawford> Yeah, watching her while she was watching you. 
09-04 22:15 <Christy King> Yeah, didn't he tell you in comm that she was taking pictures of you? Do you even know what she looks like??
09-04 22:15 <Josh Lehan> Barely, have not seen her close up
09-04 22:16 <Christy King> Just reply you don't even know who she is, but she should stop taking pics of YOU.
09-04 22:20 <Josh Lehan> I did not want to give her the satisfaction of a response
09-04 22:20 <Josh Lehan> I took out JCC but left the rest of the surroundings alone. Forced them to waste 2 Axa.
09-04 22:24 <Christy King> NICE!!
09-04 22:24 <Christy King> Are those fields still up?
09-04 22:25 <Josh Lehan> Yes - figured I have needled them enough
09-04 22:25 <Josh Lehan> If it is just me, would have trouble against their recharging
09-04 22:26 <Christy King> We have to go back for brian's car.... so right as they relax we'll take a shot at their fields hehe
09-04 22:27 <Josh Lehan> Cool where are you at
09-04 22:27 <Brian Wiebe> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.432823899999995,-121.90723689999999
09-04 22:28 <Josh Lehan> Ah right
09-04 22:28 <Josh Lehan> When would you be back?
09-04 22:28 <Christy King> 15min
09-04 22:29 <Josh Lehan> OK, I can hang out a little longer down here
09-04 22:29 <Christy King> Woohoo! We can give you gear too. =)
09-04 22:30 <Brian Wiebe> L8 resos and xmp
09-04 22:30 <Josh Lehan> Cool
09-04 22:47 <Brian Wiebe> Just exiting now
09-04 22:49 <Christy King> Ready to hit legacy
09-04 22:49 <Josh Lehan> At Erik's now and it has many sbjelds
09-04 22:50 <Christy King> Aaaaaaaaaaaand go!
09-04 22:50 <Josh Lehan> Where to meet at? Carpool?
09-04 22:51 <Christy King> We parked across from.legacy:-) comm down!
09-04 22:51 <Christy King> Uh.... c'mon  down
09-04 23:09 <Brian Wiebe> They flipped it
09-04 23:13 <Christy King> :-)SimpleStalker is here

09-05 21:27 <Josh Lehan> Cool, hi all
09-05 21:27 <Lance Fanger> Howdy
09-05 21:29 <Justin Kominar> Ah - the famous Tapit!  ☺
09-05 21:29 <Justin Kominar> KorEldin here
09-05 21:30 <Christy King> So if anyone is around today and wants to take out the fields around Vasona, just gotta knock out Marjorie Muttersback on LG Blvd and Legacy on Lark. =)
09-05 21:30 <Lance Fanger> Howdy Kor
09-05 21:31 <Christy King> I'm Seakay. Brian is working tonight, so I'll introduce him too. He is BW13B3.
09-05 21:33 <Justin Kominar> yeah, I was just looking at those portals... pretty damned tempting
09-05 21:34 <Justin Kominar> gotta leave that 4x link amped one across from their place though .. I think they fielded it up so much because they want someone to kill it so they can re-mod  ☺
09-05 21:36 <Christy King> I was thinking of dropping a Jarvis there, because a) it's nice and fast, b) that is their usual trick, and c) that would limit their options for an hour.
09-05 21:37 <Christy King> Actually, my first thought was to Jarvis all 3 anchors and link em green, right before a check point...
09-05 21:37 <Justin Kominar> meh.. I'd make them waste the jarvis... just let it slowly decay on them before they can rebuilt.
09-05 21:38 <Justin Kominar> but yes, take out everything else around it  ;)
09-05 21:40 <Justin Kominar> oh man .. there's only two easy blockers to take out to make a pretty monster field over north LG/South Campbell area
09-05 21:43 <Justin Kominar> And that super blue anchor would be en route ...
09-05 21:44 <Christy King> I could head down there if you want a hand
09-05 21:56 <Lance Fanger> Id love to see a huge field of green
09-05 21:59 <Justin Kominar> En route for phase 1
09-05 22:07 <Justin Kominar> 17k mu for that one blue mess...
09-05 22:08 <Christy King> Oh maaaaaaan! I knew I should've gotten off my couch and gone over there, lol.
09-05 22:08 <Justin Kominar> Phase 2...  Legacy church up next.
09-05 22:09 <Christy King> Thank you for knocking that out and ridding us of the monstrocity!
09-05 22:09 <Christy King> Be aware, they will probably come out and lurk on the street nearby.
09-05 22:10 <Justin Kominar> We shall see...  ;)
09-05 22:11 <Christy King> Be swift and merciless. Do not hold back!
09-05 22:15 <Justin Kominar> Meh..  Good enougb
09-05 22:15 <Justin Kominar> Phase 3: Big Green field time
09-05 22:16 <Christy King> Awesommmmmme!!
09-05 22:24 <Justin Kominar> Necessary key acquired.  Blocker 1 of 2 down.
09-05 22:25 <Christy King> I'd you take out the Gloria and Ken levy foundation, up the street from legacy, you'll knock out a bunch more fields.
09-05 22:26 <Christy King> If you..., sorry
09-05 22:27 <Justin Kominar> I left it because it was link amped
09-05 22:27 <Christy King> Damn.
09-05 22:30 <Christy King> Oh, haha, we pineapples that one last night. They must have just ADA'ed and bumped it!
09-05 22:34 <Justin Kominar> Blocker 2 down.   Off to make big field from Saratoga now
09-05 22:37 <Christy King> This is fun to watch!
09-05 22:41 <Justin Kominar> Boom
09-05 22:41 <Justin Kominar> 14.65k mu
09-05 22:42 <Justin Kominar> Wow...  For like 10 seconds.
09-05 22:42 <Justin Kominar> Did seeker take out my home portal?
09-05 22:43 <Christy King> Which is your home portal?
09-05 22:45 <Justin Kominar> First Baptist Churxh on Daves Ave
09-05 22:45 <Christy King> Yeah it looks like he went after one portal. Must've been yours.
09-05 22:45 <Justin Kominar> No, he got the end up on Bascom...
09-05 22:45 <Christy King> He took water dpt art wall.
09-05 22:45 <Justin Kominar> Well, gonna bust a few more blue fields out here in Saratoga on my way back in.
09-05 22:46 <Christy King> ...and he linked it to one near jcc.
09-05 22:47 <Christy King> But I saw you had 14649mu for a minute there!! Daaaang!
09-05 22:47 <Justin Kominar> I'll pop that thing on the way home after all...
09-05 22:48 <Justin Kominar> Too many fields regardless of the amps
09-05 22:49 <Christy King> Yup. He's pretty much asking for it.
09-05 22:50 <Christy King> JennyAppleseed already retook legacy and made a field. sheesh.
09-05 22:53 <Christy King> Aaaaah SS is using water dpt art wall as his new anchor. =P
09-05 23:00 <Christy King> You're near fruitdale, right?
09-05 23:00 <Christy King> Bunch of fields anchored around there.
09-05 23:03 <Justin Kominar> Yup
09-05 23:12 <Justin Kominar> Time to finish the job at chez seeker
09-05 23:13 <Christy King> Ah nice! He just took chameleon power box on lark, so he's in the area.
09-05 23:15 <Christy King> Actually,.he is linking from Los gatos swim and racquet club, so coast is clear.
09-05 23:29 <Justin Kominar> 90k AP for an hour and a bit's work... not too shabby
09-05 23:29 <Justin Kominar> ☺
09-05 23:29 <Justin Kominar> home now.
09-06 11:48 <Lance Fanger> Just enjoyed the farmers market downtown and made a mini field in the wake of Kor
09-06 11:49 <Lance Fanger> If somone has mocking bird key a big field open
09-06 12:01 <Justin Kominar> I do but am in Portola Valley at the moment heading out to the coast with the fam for the day.  Maybe if it's still up on the way back home.
09-06 12:02 <Justin Kominar> En route through La Honda, etc to the pacific
09-07 22:31 <Justin Kominar> Looks like the beast hath awakened  ;)
09-07 23:35 <Christy King> Yeah. Anyone want to help me knock it down Tuesday after work?
09-07 23:36 <Josh Lehan> I might be available but want to check out new arcade that opened at Eastridge 
09-08 11:16 <Christy King> I need to do some farming tonight. Is anyone able to work on removing some smurfdom around LG?
09-08 11:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I saw there's an oak hill build tonight if you need gear.
09-08 11:19 <Christy King> Yup, I will be there. =)
09-08 11:32 <Christy King> Justin, did you say you're from Waterloo, as in Canada? Brian is from there, too!
09-08 12:10 <Justin Kominar> I am, yes
09-08 12:10 <Justin Kominar> Still own a home there.  Just here "visiting" for a while  ;)
09-08 12:10 <Justin Kominar> Did he just go to school there, or is he actually from there?
09-08 12:13 <Brian Wiebe> I'm actually from there. Used to live in Upper Beachwood.
09-08 12:14 <Brian Wiebe> Went to Mary Johnston then centennial for a year before we moved here.
09-08 12:17 <Justin Kominar> Nice.. my place is right uptown on Euclid.  I went to UW, then stayed for work for 15 years afterwards before I got the job that brought me out here. My son went to Empire Public.
09-08 13:09 <Justin Kominar> I also created a few portals right around your old neighbourhood ;-)
09-08 16:20:55 *** Christy King added user 'Maria la Gorda' to conversation
09-08 16:22 <Christy King> Hi all, adding Maria to the group. Maria, what's your Agent Name?
09-08 16:25 <Josh Lehan> ###
09-08 16:26 <Josh Lehan> The sunset piano is back! 
09-08 16:26 <Maria la Gorda> Hi all, my agent name MarialaGorda
09-08 16:26 <Maria la Gorda> ☺
09-08 16:36 <Justin Kominar> Didn't it used to be an upright?
09-08 16:38 <Maria la Gorda> I've never seen the piano there. How long have piano's been there?
09-08 17:13 <Josh Lehan> I think it is seasonal only and not every year 
09-08 17:18 <Christy King> I thought it was only in the summer... why put it out just before winter??
09-08 17:31 <Josh Lehan> Vasona Park was blue now green 
09-08 17:57 <Justin Kominar> Nice
09-08 17:57 <Justin Kominar> Just took out a bunch of crap in Saratoga
09-08 17:58 <Christy King> I'm working on the trail near the back of Vasona really quick.
09-08 18:47 <Josh Lehan> Cool, I left that area for you :)
09-08 18:47 <Josh Lehan> The rest of the park is a nice easy circular walk
09-08 20:31 <Christy King> Yup I got around YSI and Circle Lot. =)
09-08 20:31 <Christy King> Nice job on the rest of the park!!
09-08 21:03 <Justin Kominar> +1k more green mu
09-08 22:12 <Maria la Gorda> ☺
09-08 22:13 <Christy King> Yayyy!!
09-08 22:13 <Brian Wiebe> Congrats on L9
09-08 22:13 <Maria la Gorda> Thank you!!!!
09-09 08:42 <Justin Kominar> Congrats!
09-09 09:21 <Maria la Gorda> Thanks!
09-09 19:32 <Christy King> Simple just took out the Perc Ponds. Probably planning a big field.
09-09 19:32 <Christy King> Anyone want to take out jcc area while he's out, hehe?
09-09 19:33 <Christy King> Or better yet, retake the Perc ponds?
09-09 19:56 <Christy King> ...and JennyAppleseed is taking out portals at Oak Hill. JCC is undefended??? GO GO GO!
09-09 20:16 <Maria la Gorda> We had a car full of frogs fighting Kehalla & one of his cubs. He, his wife, & kids split into 2 cars.
09-09 20:16 <Maria la Gorda> We stil manage to get resos & mods back on 
09-09 20:17 <Maria la Gorda> Then Jenny showed up & another smurf, cna't remember who
09-09 20:17 <Christy King> SimpleSeeker?
09-09 20:18 <Maria la Gorda> dunno... Wendy was watching comms.... I was too busy fighting & recharging
09-09 22:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Well no worries tonight with this delicious pea soup! Also flipped the water dpt art wall back to green.
09-10 13:26 <Christy King> I can't do much around LG tonight, but if anyone wants to Team up tomorrow after work, I'm available. =)
09-10 13:36 <Maria la Gorda> What time after work Christy?
09-10 13:45 <Justin Kominar> Any of you need MUFGs?  I've hacked a few extras recently.
09-10 13:47 <Brian Wiebe> I could use one for keys
09-10 13:49 <Justin Kominar> What hours are you generally out playing?  I can try and meet up, or I can drop it at my home portal if I know you're coming/there.
09-10 14:06 <Brian Wiebe> I'll probably be swinging though LG tonight quick and spending some time around Vasona tomorrow
09-10 14:44 <Christy King> Off work around 5:30 and could meet up anywhere around Vasona.
09-10 14:47 <Maria la Gorda> I can cargress with others; still can't walk for long. Let me know which one you'll be doing.
09-10 14:54 <Christy King> I can drive folks through Vasona tomorrow. =)
09-10 14:55 <Maria la Gorda> Cool! Thx Christy. Where shall we meet & what time?
09-10 14:57 <Christy King> How about Eriks Deli off LG Blvd? I can let you know when I'm heading out from work, or set a time in the 6-7 range. Earlier is best since the park closes.
09-10 14:57 <Christy King> But right now it's mostly green, we'd be bumping and adding links.
09-10 14:58 <Maria la Gorda> sounds good!
09-10 18:33 <Josh Lehan> No links today because big green field is still up
09-10 18:41 <Christy King> Yeah, I didn't realize we couldn't link under our own field. Lame!
09-10 18:41 <Christy King> I was trying to link at legacy, hehe.
09-10 18:42 <Christy King> At least it's all green. Blue can attack and turn white, but can they claim portals under a green field?
09-10 18:53 <Maria la Gorda> yes they can claim portals under green field
09-10 18:53 <Maria la Gorda> any one can 
09-10 18:53 <Maria la Gorda> no one can link or create fields
09-10 18:53 <Maria la Gorda> They actually added more layers
09-10 18:54 <Maria la Gorda> this AM there was only one layer
09-10 18:54 <Maria la Gorda> now there are 3
09-10 18:54 <Maria la Gorda> I checked  ☺
09-10 18:55 <Maria la Gorda> it's the best time to smash smurf portals
09-10 18:55 <Maria la Gorda> they're doing the same to us, so that when the field goes down, they can link
09-10 19:24 <Christy King> Yes I see that...
09-10 19:24 <Christy King> SimpleSeeker is smashing his way through Vasona right now.
09-10 19:25 <Christy King> Probably a tantrum over me taking Levant & JCC
09-10 19:37 <Maria la Gorda> downtown LG looks very blue
09-10 19:40 <Maria la Gorda> who's hidenseeker?
09-10 19:45 <Brian Wiebe> That one of Simpleseekers kids
09-10 19:53 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Pretty sure you can still only link from the outside corners of fields in
09-11 00:48 <Maria la Gorda> I think that's correct Matteo
09-11 00:49 <Maria la Gorda> thought that was one of seeker's kids
09-11 08:31 <Christy King> So far for tonight, me, Brian, and Maria. Anyone else free to take out smurfdom this evening?
09-11 08:43 <Justin Kominar> I'm a maybe.
09-11 08:43 <Justin Kominar> I can probably at least coordinate dropping off those MUFGs at some point but I don't know if I have the entire evening free for Ingressing tonight.
09-11 09:42 <Maria la Gorda> Christy what's your agent name? I'm not on HO on mobile
09-11 09:44 <Justin Kominar> She is Seakay
09-11 09:44 <Justin Kominar> /me is KorEldin
09-11 09:45 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Justin!
09-11 17:34 <Josh Lehan> I need to be in SJ at 7:30 or so, but have some free time tonight
09-11 17:34 <Josh Lehan> Plus my guardian in Ohio got smashed so I'm pissed :)
09-11 17:35 <Christy King> Let's meet at Erik's Deli again. I'll be leaving Vasona around 6pm. Does 6ish work for everyone?
09-11 17:35 <Christy King> Oh no Josh! How many days?
09-11 17:35 <Josh Lehan> 58 or 59
09-11 17:36 <Josh Lehan> OK can meet there at 6
09-11 17:44 <Maria la Gorda> I'm still in a conference call & I need to be in front of the computer 
09-11 17:44 <Maria la Gorda> for this CC
09-11 17:49 <Maria la Gorda> I'm leaving in a few mn. My conference call just ended. I'll be coming from 17 north. so Hopefully, traffic is light. I odn't have HO on mobile.
09-11 18:09 <Josh Lehan> Hi we are at Erik's
09-11 18:17 <Christy King> There in 5, sorry
09-11 18:22 <Christy King> Justin, you on your way too?
09-11 18:25 <Christy King> We'll head out, just message us if you want to meet up. I can pass the mufg on to Brian for you.
09-11 18:30 <Justin Kominar> Stuck   late at work. En route home now though. Family wants to go to Willow St pizza  for dinner so I'll be up there around 7:15ish I figure
09-11 18:30 <Justin Kominar> Can drop then if you are near
09-11 18:31 <Josh Lehan> Cool I need to go around then so we can swap places then
09-11 18:50 <Justin Kominar> Will someone be up around the main St burgers building/town square area to hand off to this evening? I'll be there in about 15 mins, so could hand off anytime from then and a couple hours after.
09-11 18:51 <Christy King> We are in park right now but maybe when it closes
09-11 18:51 <Justin Kominar> In vasona?
09-11 19:00 <Christy King> Yeah
09-11 19:04 <Justin Kominar> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.222247,-121.984359
09-11 19:05 <Justin Kominar> K   here now if anyone can pickup mufgs, just lemme know
09-11 19:47 <Brian Wiebe> @Justin, almost there.
09-11 19:50 <Brian Wiebe> Ok. I'm just outside.
09-11 19:50 <Justin Kominar> Cool.  One sec...  Will pop out.  No GPS in here to drop.
09-11 19:50 <Brian Wiebe> Haha ok.
09-11 21:20 <Josh Lehan> History Museum is at 51 S San Antonio Rd, Los Altos
09-11 21:49 <Josh Lehan> Some smurfs smashed it earlier but mostly still up
09-11 21:49 <Josh Lehan> I ran into another car with 4 ENL agents rebuilding
09-11 21:50 <Josh Lehan> So it should still be fun and there are many 8 portals remaining
09-11 21:50 <Brian Wiebe> We stopped to bust a blue field
09-11 21:50 <Josh Lehan> Cool
09-11 22:00 <Christy King> Got to dtla
09-11 22:00 <Christy King> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.3750192,-122.11507719999999
09-12 09:44 <Maria la Gorda> Christy, you wanted to know when vindalooqueen is active & where. He was in my hood!
09-12 09:44 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-12 14:17 <Christy King> That guy is everywhere!
09-12 14:19 <Maria la Gorda> according to Trung, he's got a 60 day protal in the east foothill somewhere
09-12 14:21 <Christy King> Oh yeah?? Do we know where? We were already talking about heading that way today...
09-12 14:26 <Maria la Gorda> let me find out
09-12 14:30 <Maria la Gorda> the field is coming down  :(
09-12 14:34 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Vindaloo queen is a guy?
09-12 14:34 <Maria la Gorda> yes
09-12 14:34 <Maria la Gorda> ☺
09-12 14:34 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-12 14:35 <Maria la Gorda> That was my reaction too when I learned about it 
09-12 14:45 <Maria la Gorda> You more then welcome to come on Meridian to take Vindaloo's new portals. 
09-12 14:45 <Maria la Gorda> I'm scouring Ingress/intel in the east foothill for it
09-12 14:50 <Maria la Gorda> Christy, according to Trung the intel is 2 month old
09-12 14:50 <Maria la Gorda> https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B022'48.5%22N+121%C2%B047'47.8%22W/@37.3801502,-121.7965985,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0
09-12 14:51 <Maria la Gorda> it's around here
09-12 14:52 <Maria la Gorda> It is exacly there!!!!
09-12 14:53 <Maria la Gorda> it's the Zorastrian Temple
09-12 14:55 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-12 15:09 <Christy King> Oh, that is really close to where we were thinking of going. HMMMMMM....
09-12 15:12 <Maria la Gorda> you should cuz all hell is breaking loose. The field is down
09-12 15:26 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-12 16:37 <Maria la Gorda> AWesome job you guys!
09-12 16:39 <Josh Lehan> Nice blockers to Hawaii also 
09-12 16:41 <Josh Lehan> It has been yolo link crazy up here since the big field fell. Was able to cash in a 300 AP field at my house by making use of others yolos. 
09-12 16:42 <Josh Lehan> ###
09-12 17:49 <Maria la Gorda> 👍👍👍
09-12 21:22 <Christy King> Simple started making big LG fields... buuuuut Brian and I happened to be right down the street. So... those are gone!
09-12 21:26 <Christy King> Hehehe
09-12 21:26 <Christy King> ###
09-12 23:16 <Christy King> Fields down (again... and again), and Brian had a face-to-face with a very angry SimpleSeeker.
09-12 23:18 <Maria la Gorda> WOAH
09-12 23:18 <Josh Lehan> Wow, another Simple encounter? How did it go?
09-12 23:18 <Maria la Gorda> What did Seeker say/do?
09-12 23:21 <Christy King> I was in the car, because I was worried about an encounter. It sounds like Brian held his own pretty well though.
09-12 23:21 <Christy King> I'll let him give details
09-12 23:22 <Christy King> But they chatted for awhile (OMG I was so worried in the car!) and SS did calm down
09-12 23:22 <Brian Wiebe> It started as he went onto the property of mission oaks hospital to smash and claim the portal I have just attacked. He said the security guard let him.
09-12 23:23 <Christy King> (There is a posted sign about trssspassing)
09-12 23:23 <Christy King> ###
09-12 23:23 <Christy King> Brian and I attacked and claimed from the street.
09-12 23:23 <Brian Wiebe> Hr said I could ask the guard myself but I said that's fine, it's just a game.
09-12 23:25 <Maria la Gorda> Is seeker another TravisBickle?
09-12 23:25 <Brian Wiebe> We discussed it's just a game and that I must have tresspassed to get it earlier but then I showed him how you could reach its from the sidewalk I you stood in the right sopt.
09-12 23:26 <Josh Lehan> He was traveling around smashing all our portals today I noticed, must have been pissed
09-12 23:27 <Brian Wiebe> I didn't say much and he called on it and I said I had been warned to be careful what I say and do with certain players. He was very offended at this and asked many questions about who told me. I didn't give any details.
09-12 23:27 <Christy King> @Maria I'm not sure all of what TB has done, but SS has waited for me at a trailhead calling my name in a very creepy way, and has a bad temper - If you attack his stuff at all, he retaliates on everything you've ever touched.
09-12 23:28 <Maria la Gorda> Yeah, he sent his wife to attack my portals
09-12 23:28 <Maria la Gorda> Brian, was he screaming at you?
09-12 23:28 <Brian Wiebe> He then proceeded to tell me how is is harsh with people and tends to have a short twmper.
09-12 23:29 <Josh Lehan> SimpleTemper 
09-12 23:29 <Christy King> SimplyStupid
09-12 23:29 <Brian Wiebe> No, he was quite civilized, but you could tell in the beginning he was probably mad I called him on the trespassing
09-12 23:29 <Josh Lehan> SimpleSqueaker 
09-12 23:29 <Christy King> SimpleCreeper
09-12 23:30 <Brian Wiebe> He seemed to calm down a bunch once I said that I had to be careful with what I said
09-12 23:30 <Brian Wiebe> Was told to be careful with what I said*
09-12 23:31 <Brian Wiebe> We than discussed how it was just a game and not to take it out of that context. We shook hands and I left.
09-12 23:32 <Brian Wiebe> That was the entirety of the encounter
09-12 23:32 <Christy King> I *LOVE* that Mr. "I'm reporting you for tresspassing" was mad that you called him on tresspassing!! And while he says it when we aren't actually tresspassing, he most definitely was. Should have flipped his own response back at him: Take it up with Niantic. And taken a picture.
09-12 23:33 <Brian Wiebe> He seemed to be bothered that I was warned about him.
09-12 23:34 <Brian Wiebe> I tried to take a video but I guess I hit the wrong button and it was just one dark picture :(
09-12 23:35 <Christy King> (He makes it sound so short, but it was about 45min)
09-12 23:36 <Maria la Gorda> Amazing that it was 45 mn. it took Seeker that long to calm down. Wouldn't want to be his wife or kids
09-12 23:36 <Maria la Gorda> since he admits to having a short temper
09-12 23:36 <Brian Wiebe> It wasn't 45 min with him. It was about 15 in of attack when he showed up while I was walking away, I saw him enter the walkway of the building so I hung out to let him know about the trespassing
09-12 23:36 <Christy King> SS kept saying ways he's been a dick, trying to figure out why people don't like him, haha. "I do have a short temper and am pretty vengeful..."
09-12 23:37 <Christy King> Ok so 30 min of talking. Still...
09-12 23:38 <Brian Wiebe> Oh ya I forgot to entice he also said he tended to be vengeful in the game, taking out other stuff if they take out his.
09-12 23:38 <Brian Wiebe> Mention not entice *
09-12 23:41 <Christy King> It sounds like a big chunk of the conversation was SS trying to find out who doesn't like him and is saying to be careful around him, and naming all the bad behaviors he does, and Brian being like Ummmmm... yeah, that might be why. Yeah, that too.....
09-12 23:42 <Christy King> Maybe he will do some soul searching tonight on why he's not liked, and play nicer from now on!
09-12 23:43 <Maria la Gorda> He exchanged words on COM with Sascha & wasn't very talkative
09-12 23:43 <Christy King> Tonight?
09-12 23:44 <Maria la Gorda> no, during the week
09-12 23:44 <Christy King> (Is that Spellfire?)
09-12 23:44 <Maria la Gorda> he took out OH
09-12 23:44 <Maria la Gorda> yes
09-12 23:44 <Maria la Gorda> Spellfire is Sascha
09-12 23:45 <Maria la Gorda> I thought Spellfire was female until I met him. LOL
09-12 23:46 <Christy King> Yeah, he tried to tell me a few times I was tresspassing because the park was closing (not closed) and he was reporting me. When I responded one time that I was ok'd by a ranger (SAME reasoning he gave Brian tonight, btw), he said "Explain it to Niantic, I'm blocking you."
09-12 23:46 <Christy King> And that was the only time I'd ever messaged him on comm.
09-12 23:47 <Maria la Gorda> what a troll
09-12 23:47 <Christy King> (And then once more recently calling him out on his 2nd, GREEN account)
09-12 23:48 <Christy King> Yeah.
09-12 23:50 <Christy King> I hope he didn't take OH out because I'd deployed on it last week. He does tend to attack ANYTHING I touch in the LG area.
09-12 23:50 <Maria la Gorda> no, he does on a regular basis
09-12 23:55 <Maria la Gorda> I'm glad it didn't turn into a Dickle. But I wonder if it would have been different if it Christy instead of Brian that came face to face with Seeker
09-14 13:57:07 *** Christy King added user 'fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck' to conversation
09-14 13:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ahoy folks!
09-14 13:57 <Christy King> Adding Barbara aka bluefish2317
09-14 13:57 <Brian Wiebe> Welcome back
09-14 13:57 <Christy King> =)
09-14 13:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yall can call me bluefish or barbara, I respond to both :-)
09-14 14:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Reading the scroll buffer,  I can provide a little bit of Intel on vindalooqueen
09-14 14:12 <Christy King> Ooh??
09-14 14:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He's an independent nature photographer for a living, so he plays all over at times
09-14 14:14 <Christy King> Oooooh
09-14 14:14 <Christy King> That's actually pretty cool, too bad he's blue!
09-14 14:14 <Christy King> What's his real name, do you know?
09-14 14:15 <Christy King> (Wondering if my nature photography friend knows him)
09-14 14:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't
09-14 15:08 <Maria la Gorda> Hey Bluefish!!!!  ☺
09-14 15:10 <Justin Kominar> Howdy Barbara!  I have a bunch of keys I've been farming for you to get to you sometime.
09-14 17:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo! I've got some but need to gather up some more
09-14 17:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hi maria! Looks like a nice crew we got here!
09-14 17:20 <Christy King> Best crew ever!
09-14 17:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
09-14 19:06 <Josh Lehan> Hi Seakay - I am also going to park 
09-14 19:22 <Christy King> Yay!
09-14 19:23 <Christy King> I left Oak Meadow for you to demolish, and also around pier. :-)
09-14 19:26 <Josh Lehan> Cool thanks
09-14 19:27 <Josh Lehan> Anywhere else in park I should go before dusk? Will raise portals to 6.
09-14 19:27 <Christy King> Bump everywhere! Circle Lot is blue, white along ysi trail
09-14 19:28 <Christy King> I'm sooooo close to L9. Perhaps I should take out a few fields...
09-14 19:28 <Christy King> ...say, north of Lark...
09-14 19:31 <Christy King> Or not. He is here, recharging and creepy.
09-14 19:37 <Maria la Gorda> I destroyed soem of Vindaloo's fields late this afternoon. he's taking them back now LOL
09-14 19:45 <Christy King> Fortunately, I think he still hasn't figured out who I am, bwahaha.
09-14 19:45 <Christy King> When he met Brian the other day, he thought that was seakay.
09-14 19:45 <Maria la Gorda> HAHAHA
09-14 19:46 <Christy King> And I like to do things like skip around on portals so he can't predict where I'll go, and pretend like I'm just lost or on the phone on my car.
09-14 19:47 <Christy King> I don't think he even suspects that his nemesis destroying all his portals could be a GIRL.
09-14 19:48 <Christy King> Go Maria! Take em down!
09-14 19:49 <Maria la Gorda> have less than 200 bursters, low on res & OH is all blue thx to Vindaloo & another smurf
09-14 19:56 <Josh Lehan> Did what I could. Got as far as footbridge. Storm clouds bring darkness fast!
09-14 19:56 <Christy King> I recharged on OH earlier... but the force is strong with that one, and so is the lag. =(
09-14 19:57 <Christy King> Yayyyyy Josh!!
09-14 19:57 <Christy King> I can do a little more tomorrow after work. Or perhaps even at lunchtime.
09-14 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> yeah so did I & the portals went poof & turned blue
09-14 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> in matter of seconds
09-14 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> I think attributing to it is a huge lag
09-14 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> I was heaving a hard time picking up keys
09-14 19:59 <Josh Lehan> I helped a young lady escape the park and find the entrance where her car was before she got locked in! Made it out safely.
09-14 19:59 <Maria la Gorda> as well. When I picked the keys up, it showed that that they were still on the ground. 
09-14 19:59 <Maria la Gorda> 🙌🙌🙌
09-14 20:00 <Josh Lehan> YSI are your portals :) everything else in park can be fixed by walking the big loop from entrance to footbridge and back again
09-14 20:01 <Christy King> 🏆
09-14 20:01 <Maria la Gorda> What does YSI stand for?
09-14 20:01 <Christy King> That is your "help people in real life" badge
09-14 20:02 <Christy King> YSI = Youth Science Institute = where I work. =)
09-14 20:02 <Christy King> There are several portals right there.
09-14 20:03 <Christy King> But I'm happy to share them! ...with anyone GREEN.
09-14 20:03 <Maria la Gorda> right!
09-14 20:04 <Josh Lehan> It is nice to see the black of darkness descend into the park and know that the portals are sealed green until morning
09-14 20:05 <Christy King> Yup!
09-14 20:06 <Christy King> Btw I'll be out of reception and teaching all morning, so if anyone has keys for vasona portals, be ready to recharge against SS and JA retaliation tomorrow.
09-14 20:08 <Christy King> (But when I come back to Vasona after, I can attack or link a little as I drive in.)
09-14 20:12 <Justin Kominar> Are you not sup[posed to be in Vasona after dark?  Do they actively monitor that?  I know they gates are locked so you can't drive in, but can just not just walk in?
09-14 20:13 <Brian Wiebe> You can reach a good portion of them from the sidewalk outside, also you can be leaving the park after sunset you just can't go in
09-14 20:14 <Justin Kominar> But if I were to go walk the dog over there right now, for example?\
09-14 20:14 <Justin Kominar> Is the park staffed at night and patrolling?
09-14 20:17 <Christy King> Not staffed at night, but if you're inside the park after they close (or even before, hehe), SimplyStupid will be alllllllll over it to report you for tresspassing.
09-14 20:18 <Christy King> I don't think the Rangers would give a damn about someone walking their dog at night... but I don't know how Niantic reacts.
09-14 20:23 <Maria la Gorda> Niantic doesn't give a shit
09-14 20:23 <Maria la Gorda> Smurfs have been breaking the laws & nothing happens
09-14 20:24 <Christy King> Yikes. That's no good!!
09-14 20:32 <Maria la Gorda> I was reading public frustration on Ingress communities
09-14 20:36 <Justin Kominar> everything I can find online officially states Vasona and Oak Meadow are open until sunset or shortly thereafter.
09-14 20:36 <Justin Kominar> So he probably has a point.
09-15 08:31 <Justin Kominar> Just unwound moat of the blue mess in South LG
09-15 08:31 <Justin Kominar> Most...
09-15 09:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Got onyx trekker this am woo!
09-15 09:38 <Justin Kominar> wow
09-15 09:38 <Justin Kominar> that was fast!  nice work
09-15 09:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well I was real close to level 16 when I flipped
09-15 09:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Been playing pretty hard for a year now
09-15 09:59 <Justin Kominar> Did you keep your km's walked when you flipped though?  I thought you had to start over/
09-15 10:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You keep badges,  lose all ap and inventory
09-15 10:00 <Justin Kominar> Ah
09-15 10:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Badges /stats
09-15 10:01 <Justin Kominar> ok - that's less "wow" then  ;)  I thought you had to completely restart.
09-15 10:01 <Justin Kominar> Still, impressive achievement
09-15 10:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah not that bad
09-15 10:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Flipping wasn't a big deal at all
09-15 10:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have all the badges I will need for 16 now
09-15 10:05 <Justin Kominar> Huge AP grind back up to 16 though  :(
09-15 10:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Aye
09-15 10:06 <Justin Kominar> I'm still trucking towards 15 myself.
09-15 10:06 <Justin Kominar> Should hit it in a couple weeks at the pace I'm keeping.
09-15 10:06 <Justin Kominar> Did almost 100k this morning though, which helped a lot.  Hopefully they actually start doing more fielding again around LG.... they'd been slow for so long, it was hard to get any meaningful AP.
09-15 10:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
09-15 10:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I need another 600k ap for level 10
09-15 10:24 <Maria la Gorda> You'll get it easily Barbara! 
09-15 10:24 <Maria la Gorda> Come to West San Jose. We're outnumbered.
09-15 10:25 <Maria la Gorda> Justin
09-15 10:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'm not too worried about higher levels
09-15 10:50 <Justin Kominar> Well, that's sorta my problem.. I really don't have a tonne of spare time for specific ingressing... it's always opportune ingressing  ;)  So stuff mainly between work and home.
09-15 10:50 <Justin Kominar> And if I happen to be out somewhere on the weekends, maybe I can justify some new exploration in combination with errands w/ the fam.
09-15 10:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah kinda same here somewhat
09-15 10:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Seems like the smurfs are asleep at the wheel lately
09-15 10:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone else get that impression.?
09-15 11:00 <Justin Kominar> Seeker told me he was taking a break... letting his son's get the AP for a while because he didn't need it - but I don't know if they have quite the same ... umm ... zeal, that he does.
09-15 11:00 <Justin Kominar> I think he grew tired of the green everywhere and woke back up recently, though.
09-15 11:00 <Justin Kominar> Although, his wife seems way more active than he is even still, lately.
09-15 11:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I haven't had my home portal attacked in days!
09-15 11:01 <Justin Kominar> Do you use the church there?  or a different one?
09-15 11:02 <Justin Kominar> There's a few around Bubb... I can make a point of bumping whatever ones you would prefer.
09-15 11:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Art deco wall is my home portal
09-15 11:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 41m from my apt
09-15 11:03 <Justin Kominar> noted.
09-15 12:44 <Maria la Gorda> Most likely SimpleCreeper will tag along his son. he'll still be a dick if you take out his son's portal. A dick is always a dick
09-15 12:46 <Justin Kominar> I kill his entire family's stuff regularly.  He's never been a dick to me. A bit creepy, sure ... but so far, I've yet to have an overly negative experience in any of my run-ins with him.
09-15 16:55 <Christy King> Been offline all day. Barbara, congrats on going onyx!
09-15 16:56 <Christy King> Justin, what if you attack / take over / field over the jcc area? He doesn't seek and destroy all portals with even a whiff of your name?
09-15 17:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I gotta get a new bike soon, and I need to farm
09-15 17:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Badly
09-15 17:18 <Maria la Gorda> outta gear too. need x8 badly.
09-15 18:55 <Christy King> I'm gonna see if I can set up a LG farm night with a big crew! Either way, I'm free tomorrow to get ap, destroy blue, and set up at least a mini farm as high level as we can get it.
09-15 18:56 <Christy King> It looks like SS is working with SculpinBreath on the park right now, from different sides, if anyone wants to counter attack... *cough cough* Justin *cough*
09-15 19:02 <Maria la Gorda> I'm free after 9:30pm tomorrow night. Friday, later in the evening
09-15 19:04 <Christy King> Darn, Vasona will be closed by then
09-15 19:04 <Christy King> I'll be free both nights starting around 5:30
09-15 19:30 <Justin Kominar> I'm so close yet so far...  Right across the street at puppy training class, unfortunately.
09-15 19:30 <Justin Kominar> I've had my fun for the day.
09-15 19:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> First week back at work since vacation and it's killing me
09-15 19:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 2 10 hour days so far and I think if I wanna just work 8 hours I have to just work 8 hours then stop caring
09-15 19:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways its affecting my ingress
09-15 19:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Haha

09-15 20:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Confirm with her but that's my understanding
09-15 20:41 <Christy King> She says yes =)
09-15 20:42:10 *** Christy King added user 'Paula E' to conversation
09-15 20:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Welcome paula! Wanna go help build tomorrow?  :-)

09-15 21:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too late
09-15 21:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I said things
09-15 21:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Please remove me from the hangout if I'm too terrible
09-15 21:07 <Christy King> You're fine!
09-15 21:10 <Paula E> @ Blue I'm hoping to be there around 5:30. 
09-15 21:10 <Christy King> Miss Bluefishy can come early with you if she wants =)
09-15 21:11 <Paula E> Hooray

09-15 21:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or just remove me either way
09-15 21:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm tired of people and their bs is all
09-15 21:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just tired of it
09-15 21:17 <Christy King> Is millburray green or blue?
09-15 21:17 <Paula E> @ Blue damn girl you cut deep!! Lol 
09-15 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Blue and I just gave him an earful
09-15 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> In comms

09-15 21:21 <Paula E> Your comments were intriguing so I got on ingress. I can't read his only your comments 
09-15 21:21 <Paula E> Man down 
09-15 21:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> His stuff was just I'm hangouts he called me a rude bitch for calling his gf out
09-15 21:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Who came only for my home portal, nothing else
09-15 21:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug
09-15 21:23 <Paula E> Eh, don't let them have power over you. 
09-15 21:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If I had kept quiet that would have been them having power over me
09-15 21:26 <Christy King> Josh, fear not, we'll do another round of farming another day!
09-15 21:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So I said my part
09-15 21:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shouting at me then blocking me is a good way to make me wanna be mean to you,  just saying
09-15 21:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways
09-15 21:35 <Paula E> I hear you
09-15 21:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> However if you're mad at me and wanna yell at me but then cool off and we talk, I have much more patience with that
09-15 21:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll stop trying to explain
09-15 21:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Clearance to leave work at 5
09-16 10:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can't actually make it tonight
09-16 11:09 <Christy King> Booooo!
09-16 11:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can't move, sorry
09-16 13:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If we play more dubstep will that get you moving Barbara?
09-16 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No lol
09-16 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just have pain today and need to take it easy
09-16 22:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok look sorry, I feel like I made everyone uncomfortable
09-16 22:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And don't want that
09-16 22:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So am gonna leave the hangout but only cause I don't wanna be the one making folks uncomfortable
09-16 22:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Re add me if you wanna I just do t wanna be the reason people got quiet
09-16 22:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry
09-16 22:41:31 *** fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck removed user 'fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck' from conversation
09-16 23:29 <Maria la Gorda> What happened with Barbara?? 
09-17 07:16 <Christy King> I think she figured we were a more chatty group and were quiet because she was here. I guess there are people out there that don't trust her because she flipped? I'm pretty sure everyone was just busy though, right?
09-17 07:18 <Christy King> Is there anyone uncomfortable with her in the group, or should I offer to add her back? I guess PM me if you do not want her added. If I get 2+ no's by Friday, I won't add.
09-17 07:20 <Christy King> Otherwise, I'll add her back on Friday. I already let her know we're often quiet and everyone was busy last night and probably just not online.
09-17 09:41 <Maria la Gorda> I'm comfortable with her. I don't think LG HO is very chatty compared to the other HO. But they also have a lot more members too... That's my opinion.
09-17 17:29 <Christy King> Argh!! SS just ripped through the park, but I'm almost out of bursters! Gonna hack a bunch at dinner tonight.
09-17 17:30 <Christy King> If anyone wants to visit Vasona in the meantime though, much ap to be had!
09-17 17:30 <Christy King> I'm also up for a group outing Friday night. =)
09-17 17:41 <Justin Kominar> Wow.  He's pissed
09-17 17:41 <Justin Kominar> They vr/axa'd everything
09-17 17:41 <Justin Kominar> I just toasted a few external perimeter ones, but this will take some work to undo.
09-17 17:42 <Justin Kominar> Can't believe they waste all their good shields on this kinda stuff ...
09-17 17:46 <Christy King> I don't get how I piss him off so much, but I guess I'm flattered for all the attention...?
09-17 17:46 <Christy King> Probably didn't like that I fielded it all in an hour by myself, haha.
09-17 17:47 <Christy King> I'm taking out the ones near ysi
09-17 17:48 <Christy King> He probably steals gear from his kids, the jerk.
09-17 17:49 <Christy King> Actually... we KNOW he cheats and has a 2nd *green* account. He probably uses that as a mule account too. Or has even more than 2. Who knows! When you ignore the rules, anything is possible.
09-17 17:57 <Justin Kominar> They have an event going on in the park I think.  Hacking mods all over, and some blue name I've never seen before immediately recaptured the sign on the corner I just captured
09-17 17:58 <Justin Kominar> Anyhow...  Did what I could in the limited time I had.   I wouldn't be surprised to see LG turn blue tonight
09-17 17:58 <Christy King> They have an event to ight in alviso. I just posted that to the HO.
09-17 17:58 <Christy King> Well... Anyone free tomorrow night to make it green?
09-17 18:44 <Josh Lehan> I am really out of bursters and resonators also, been doing a lot of playing in SF and at home 
09-17 18:45 <Josh Lehan> Will be fun to tear through park once properly equipped - any farms or builds happening tonite? 
09-17 18:49 <Christy King> Wanna come?
09-17 18:50 <Paula E> Sounds like fun, but I'm still down for the count with a migraine. 
09-17 18:50 <Christy King> Tonight, I don't know of any here (SJ/LG), but they usually have downtown Santa Cruz and all of Scotts Valley green EP8.
09-17 18:51 <Christy King> And if folks can restock to ight, I am sooooooooooo up for Destructo-Friday!!
09-17 18:51 <Christy King> My phone seems to think it's "to ight" instead of "tonight" haha
09-17 18:55 <Paula E> Watch for alviso Adobe park blue should be building it to 8's. They are having a pizza party at 6:30Then building
09-17 22:00 <Christy King> New plan. I fell asleep and did not make it to Santa Cruz (or anywhere) to farm. Did others farm? Tomorrow either you all can smash and I'll help deploy, or we could all farm somewhere tomorrow and then hit LG maybe Saturday?
09-17 22:07 <Maria la Gorda> I won't be able to make it tomorrow  :(
09-17 22:07 <Christy King> BTW Justin, he only used regular shields around YSI. Maybe running out?? The dam was a mix of 2 regular and 2 rare.
09-17 22:08 <Christy King> Let's hope he's finally running out! Geez.
09-17 22:08 <Maria la Gorda> Josh, we built at Oak Hill in San Jose
09-17 22:08 <Maria la Gorda> but it usually get hit the day after
09-17 22:10 <Maria la Gorda> or you could always glyph hack where the smurfs built and then smash it
09-17 22:11 <Maria la Gorda> that's what we did to their micro farm one day. We sat, glyph hacked & destroyed when we were done
09-17 22:15 <Christy King> Hmmmm...
09-17 22:16 <Christy King> Do you get many bursters glyph hacking enemy portals?
09-17 22:17 <Justin Kominar> Science says it doesn't matter what alignment the portal is.
09-17 22:18 <Maria la Gorda> I do
09-17 22:18 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You get better payout from friendlies
09-17 22:18 <Maria la Gorda> you just get zapped
09-17 22:18 <Christy King> Wellllllllll thennnnnnnnn.....
09-17 22:18 <Justin Kominar> That is widely considered untrue.
09-17 22:19 <Maria la Gorda> that you get zapped?
09-17 22:19 <unknown_105969224114245383430> But I personally feel percentage of payouts that are bursters are higher on enemy portals
09-17 22:19 <Christy King> And I did put a patch of green back in Vasona, so there are a few friendlies (but only L5. Need bumping!!)
09-17 22:19 <Justin Kominar> There was a brief time when Niantic was experimenting with different drop rates based on faction, but it didn't last long and is back to uniform distribution now. But yes, you do get zapped by the blue ones :)
09-17 22:20 <Christy King> Ok, so are folks up for some glyph-n-hack fun tomorrow evening?
09-17 22:20 <Justin Kominar> It's just coincidence/psychological if you are finding that blues are giving you more bursters at the moment
09-17 22:21 <Justin Kominar> And Christy, just scrolling back...  I hope he ran out of shields.  I popped 4 axas and 12 vrs on just the few I smashes there tonight.
09-17 22:22 <Justin Kominar> And I saw a bunch more on some of the others I looked at bunch couldn't reachm
09-17 22:22 <Justin Kominar> They tended to put the hard stuff on the perimeter to fight off drive by blasts, and left tel he softer shields for the interior.
09-17 22:23 <Maria la Gorda> I'm not getting MODs from portals.
09-17 22:24 <Justin Kominar> It's all just a game of odds.  It'll even out over time.
09-17 22:24 <Justin Kominar> For ages I got no mufgs.  Like...  Months.  Then all the sudden, bam, 3 in 2 days.
09-17 22:31 <Maria la Gorda> I need more Mufgs, more AXA, ADA, Jarvis
09-17 22:31 <Josh Lehan> Nice, at DTLA and it is still up, I noticed SeaKay name on many portals
09-17 22:32 <Maria la Gorda> the smurfs were too busy partying & rollling in Milptias
09-17 22:32 <Maria la Gorda> tonight
09-18 07:42 <Justin Kominar> Maria, I have a mufg I can share with you
09-18 09:12 <Maria la Gorda> Awesome! Thx Justin. I can meet on Sat for pick up.
09-18 09:19 <Justin Kominar> I'm sure we can arrange something soon.  Turns out it looks like I have 2 too spare at the moment.
09-18 09:47 <Maria la Gorda> Christy & Brian, do you know any ENL players on Kona to take out this anchor https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=18.963442,-155.619278&z=15
09-18 10:13 <Paula E> Catching up, I have mufg's if anyone still needs some. I work early tomorrow morning, but possibly can help before
09-18 10:14 <Paula E> After or tonight
09-18 10:21 <Christy King> @Maria, no we don't. We were there for our honeymoon.
09-18 16:17 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Paula!
09-18 16:17 <Maria la Gorda>  I need to sort out what to recycle. Acquired too many keys. I feel like I'm a key lady
09-18 16:23 <Christy King> Keep some Vasona keys for now, to recharge.
09-18 17:01 <Maria la Gorda> Christy, is @thesneak the one who took out the HI portal?
09-18 18:22 <Maria la Gorda> I went farming for an hour today, I got mostly resonators 😤😤
09-18 18:23 <Christy King> Yes, according to the L8 chat group
09-18 18:25 <Maria la Gorda> I should have gone farming in Alviso to get more xmps
09-18 18:30 <Christy King> Oh hey, I got only positive comments about Barbara, so I'm readding her. =)
09-18 18:31:04 *** Christy King added user 'fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck' to conversation
09-18 18:31 <Christy King> No more spanking and ditching us, hahaha!
09-18 18:31 <Christy King> WHOA phone
09-18 18:31 <Christy King> Spazzing
09-18 18:31 <Christy King> Apparently, it's not a word, but anyways
09-18 18:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
09-18 18:32 <Maria la Gorda> WOAH, who's spanking who??? It's like the folsom street fair
09-18 18:32 <Maria la Gorda> :P
09-18 18:32 <Christy King> My phone has appently been very bored, wants to stir up trouble!!
09-18 18:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm just a bit nervous with new people and will eventually settle into a groove
09-18 18:33 <Christy King> But next time, feel free to put up a screenshot of the comm so we can join in the chat! I think most of us didn't see it so no one had any comments.
09-18 18:33 <Maria la Gorda> Well I gotta run my froggy Cats! Have a wonderful friday!
09-18 18:34 <Christy King> Just remember: We ain't the res. We cool.
09-18 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
09-19 08:58 <Maria la Gorda> Who's Rota333? Is that Simple's kid?
09-19 09:52 <Justin Kominar> Simple's kids are "______Seeker" (can't remember), and "Other People"
09-19 09:52 <Justin Kominar> Rota333 is new
09-19 09:52 <Justin Kominar> to the area
09-19 09:52 <Justin Kominar> Come by Walgreens from 10:30-12 today and firm up a portal while supporting my son's cub scout pack!  ;)
09-19 09:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> He's normally more south SJ
09-19 10:09 <Christy King> HideandSeeker I think. At least, I've seen that name around. How old are his kids though? They have to be at least 13 to have an accoint, right?
09-19 10:10 <Christy King> Justin, what's your son's pack doing/selling? Boy scout equivalent to GS Cookies?? =)
09-19 11:34 <Maria la Gorda> Breakfast! Went overboard on the berries but it's all good  ☺
09-19 11:35 <Maria la Gorda> You can always lie about your age. Most websites & apps don't ask kids to prove that they're under 13 & most parents will vouch for their kids anyway
09-19 11:36 <Christy King> Ohhh my god, YUM!!!
09-19 11:36 <Christy King> Where was that???
09-19 11:36 <Maria la Gorda> I made it  ☺
09-19 11:36 <Maria la Gorda> I originally was going to buy croissants at Cocola but I was too lazy to get out of my house
09-19 11:36 <Christy King> Breakfast at Maria's tomorrow everybody!
09-19 11:37 <Justin Kominar> They are selling various flavours of popcorn
09-19 11:37 <Maria la Gorda> first cheese burgers at Justins!!!
09-19 11:37 <Maria la Gorda> cheeseburgers & fries
09-19 11:37 <Justin Kominar> We are here for 20 more mins...  But there will be others here the rest of the day selling.
09-19 11:38 <Christy King> That's true, you could totally lie about your kids ages. It would be funny for someone so adamant about other rules  (ie park closing times) to do so... but smurfs aren't known for their smarts.
09-19 11:39 <Christy King> Ooh I am addicted to popcorn!! Had I only known!  Is today the only day they're selling? =((
09-19 13:01 <Justin Kominar> They're selling all day there, and next weekend too I believe.  Then the weekend after that we're at Whole Foods.
09-19 13:01 <Justin Kominar> But we can always take orders if you aren't able to attend in person.
09-19 13:07 <Christy King> I'll try to make it in person if I can, since that's more fun. When is your pack out next?
09-19 13:08 <Christy King> I'll come say hi!
09-19 21:00 <Maria la Gorda> Vindaloo must be trying to level up. He's been smashing & fileding since this AM
09-19 21:14 <Christy King> The same portals, all day? ^_^;;
09-19 22:14 <Maria la Gorda> Whos' agent Tapitipuku?
09-19 23:34 <Paula E> Congrats Maria way to go no. 2!!!
09-19 23:34 <Maria la Gorda> really??? Let me check!
09-19 23:35 <Maria la Gorda> Hot diggy dog! I'm the #2 ENL agent!! I really don't know how that happened!
09-19 23:36 <Maria la Gorda> I thought others fielded bigger
09-19 23:36 <Paula E> Tapitipuku is an agent that lives in Los gatos. I started ingress 11/14 and I believe he started before me. He's slowed way down on Ingressing lately.
09-19 23:37 <Paula E> You're awesome, you've found your groove. Stick with it!
09-19 23:37 <Maria la Gorda> I actually went home sick from fielding. 
09-19 23:37 <Maria la Gorda> thx Paula! 
09-19 23:38 <Paula E> It can take a toll on you, that's for sure. 
09-19 23:39 <Maria la Gorda> I miswrote. I had to cut my ingressing because I was feeling sick.
09-19 23:39 <Maria la Gorda> I was nauseous  
09-19 23:39 <Maria la Gorda> still am
09-19 23:39 <Maria la Gorda> :(
09-19 23:47 <Paula E> There's stuff going around. My son wAs out sick Thursday and Friday from school 
09-19 23:48 <Maria la Gorda> Poor little guy. Hope he's on the road to recovery
09-20 00:04 <Paula E> Lol "little guy" he's 15 and 6'2 a sophomore. Little he's not, but my baby he will always be. He's getting better thx. Do you need anything?
09-20 01:00 <Maria la Gorda> I'm good. Just drank a lot of water and ate some carbs. Thx Paula!
09-20 01:31 <Paula E> You bet
09-20 10:06 <Christy King> If still nauseous, also try ginger ale or sprite. =(
09-20 10:07 <Christy King> Was there a lot of blue around where you were? That makes me feel icky too...
09-20 13:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I gotta get a new bike
09-20 13:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or I should say a working bike
09-20 13:44 <Christy King> Agreed. I vote you get a new/working bike soon. =)
09-20 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I am gonna uber over to wheel away
09-20 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> They look decent
09-20 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I dunno
09-20 14:13 <Maria la Gorda> Paula, probably all the blue was making me sick to my stomach
09-20 14:13 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-20 14:14 <Maria la Gorda> Barbara, get a working bike. When my ankle gets better, I plan on getting back on my bike. So we can bikegress together  ☺

09-20 14:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I like the look of that place and the dude on the phone was nice
09-20 14:24 <Christy King> They really need to fix the barfing cat to have a blue barf option...
09-20 14:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone have any bad impressions from wheel away
09-20 14:28 <Christy King> Never been.

09-20 14:41 <Maria la Gorda> LOL I was wondering why I'm being invited to a video call

09-20 18:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah he took my home portal and said weird shit to me
09-20 18:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> About some people want to watch the world burn
09-20 18:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So uh yeah I said we're called burners and fire is good rah rah
09-20 18:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh
09-20 18:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But without trying to sound like a fire psycho pyromaniac

09-21 00:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Blade runner was ok though
09-21 09:57 <Maria la Gorda> Did Blade runner & that sketchy guy at CCC get into an altercation?

09-21 16:21 <Justin Kominar> awesome!
09-21 16:22 <Justin Kominar> I'm pretty hurting for gear at the moment, so I may be a bit less active this week.
09-21 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am excited for winter
09-21 17:05 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Winter is coming?
09-21 17:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lord I hope so
09-21 17:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Asap
09-21 17:13 <Maria la Gorda> Winter = too many clothes to wear
09-21 17:13 <Maria la Gorda> not a fan
09-21 17:22 <Christy King> I'm going to be pretty unavailable this week also. Maybe something tomorrow night? Then I'll be out of town for the weekend.
09-21 17:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I got massage therapy from 6 til 7 at pruneyard
09-21 17:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Available after
09-21 18:38 <Christy King> Anyone else wanna stomp through Vasona and make it rain green tomorrow?
09-21 18:50 <Maria la Gorda> I won't be able to make it tomorrow
09-21 18:52 <Christy King> I'll be off work around 5, 5:30 at the latest.

09-21 19:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Best I can do!
09-21 19:01 <Josh Lehan> I am low on gear as well
09-21 19:04 <Christy King> Me too. Hack-and-attack?
09-21 19:11 <Christy King> He's going after Oak Meadow.....
09-21 19:12 <Josh Lehan> Maybe he will waste more shields this time
09-21 19:18 <Christy King> Oh, I bet so!
09-21 19:31 <Josh Lehan> Maybe now is a time for a JCC run whilst he is at park 
09-21 19:33 <Maria la Gorda> I can't move. My stomach is killing me. I ate really old soy sauce... 
09-21 19:55 <Josh Lehan> Or maybe not - feeling somewhat down today, will just go home 
09-21 19:59 <Christy King> Perfect, you two are on jcc duty. The sicker the better. Get right in his face and cough.
09-21 20:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh was there a SC build tonight
09-21 20:11 <Maria la Gorda> I thought it was yesterday but I just got a notice that it started  :(
09-21 20:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###

09-21 20:38 <Maria la Gorda> 🙌🙌🙌🙌
09-21 21:04 <Christy King> Right now? Just had dinner near Santana Row. But weekdays, I am *in* it.
09-21 21:12 <Maria la Gorda> fight going doing down in dtsj between ENL player & dickle
09-22 13:19 <Josh Lehan> FYI, the JCC closes early today, 5 PM, and then remains closed all of Wednesday 
09-22 13:19 <Josh Lehan> For Yom Kippur 
09-22 13:20 <Josh Lehan> Making the JCC portals green or white at 5 PM today might be a fun gesture 
09-22 13:25 <Christy King> Oh yes yes yes!! Who can get there by 5?
09-22 13:25 <Christy King> Also, Josh, how are you typing in bold?
09-22 13:28 <Paula E> What is JCC?
09-22 13:33 <Christy King> Jewish Community Center, on Lark. Aka SimpleSeeker and Jenny's home base.
09-22 13:37 <Justin Kominar> Nothing to it! ;)
09-22 13:38 <Justin Kominar> Can even get a little slanty!
09-22 14:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
09-22 17:21 <Josh Lehan> Don't know why it came up in bold
09-22 17:21 <Josh Lehan> Also work was being work today, so unfortunately did not make it to JCC
09-22 17:38 <Christy King> Someone did, I saw it was white earlier
09-22 17:50 <Josh Lehan> Cool, I got it last night :)
09-22 17:51 <Christy King> Still white!!
09-22 17:51 <Christy King> But blue fields all around it. =(
09-23 08:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey so

09-24 00:02 <Justin Kominar> Let's see if I can lure seeker out of bed with a few large LG midnight fields ;-)
09-24 04:41 <Paula E> RES is firelding from page mill in Los altos to downtown Saratoga so far.
09-24 06:54 <Christy King> Justin: How did it go? Picture??
09-24 06:54 <Christy King> Maria: Where at in Saratoga?
09-24 07:12 <Christy King> I see some big links. Bad news for them. I happen to be going to Saratoga for work this morning! I hope I have enough bursters...

09-24 09:32 <Paula E> Thanks for your help christy
09-24 09:32 <Christy King> No problem! Slowly turning Sanborn Park green...
09-24 09:34 <Paula E> If it were dark I'd come help, but I'm melting now. Migraine again-need dark room with ice
09-24 09:37 <Christy King> Feel better!!
09-24 10:06 <Paula E> I should've dropped you some gear. I'm just not on top of my game lately, sorry.
09-24 11:11 <Maria la Gorda> Feel better Paula!
09-24 11:21 <Christy King> No worries! They were on you so fast, they probably would have gotten to it first lol.
09-24 11:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey so maybe can come to lg tonight after work
09-24 17:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'm pretty much outta gear
09-24 18:22 <Christy King> Get out there and glyph hack! I'm all for farming in LG but I can't coordinate or attend until next week. So, Monday night?
09-24 19:47 <Maria la Gorda> Is plantman24 a santa cruz smurf?
09-24 19:56 <Christy King> Don't know, but I can ask the SC group. Why do you think that?
09-24 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> either a Santa Cruz or Monterey smurf... his mission badges are mostly from the central coast area
09-24 20:00 <Christy King> Confirmed he's from Santa cruz. Where do you see him?
09-24 20:00 <Christy King> And was it just now, or earlier?
09-24 20:01 <Maria la Gorda> He hit one of my portals at 7:37pm 
09-24 20:01 <Maria la Gorda> https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=37.294676,-121.932739&z=15
09-24 20:03 <Christy King> According to Matt in SC, that guy sucks at ingress. =)
09-25 20:04 <Christy King> Well... Vasona was green for a few hours today. u_u
09-25 21:59 <Josh Lehan> Hi again, been neglecting Ingress because work and life
09-25 22:01 <Josh Lehan> Legacy Church near JCC has gone RP8
09-25 22:05 <Josh Lehan> Will attack it now, not looking forward to a Simple encounter though
09-25 22:05 <Christy King> Good luck.
09-25 22:26 <Josh Lehan> He said "I don't talk to you anymore" then remained silent and smoking away
09-25 22:27 <Christy King> Ew he smokes too?
09-25 22:28 <Josh Lehan> Yes chain smokes clove cigarettes
09-25 22:28 <Christy King> Ugh.
09-25 22:29 <Christy King> Just keep stepping one step closer and saying "How about now?"
09-25 22:33 <Josh Lehan> Win! He Jarvised his own portals and eventually smashed when I just stood around and glyphed. He said "Go stand somewhere else"!
09-25 22:34 <Christy King> Oh now THERE'S a fat piece of irony pie.
09-25 22:34 <Christy King> Well done, sir! WELL DONE!!!
09-25 22:35 <Josh Lehan> And I did not have to fire a single burster :)
09-25 22:36 <Christy King> And did you say "I thought you didn't talk to me anymore"? ^_^;;
09-25 22:37 <Christy King> Why did he Jarvis it?? I don't understand his logic!
09-25 22:37 <Christy King> "Logic"
09-25 23:08 <Josh Lehan> And he popped his couch portal too while I was there even though only RP7
09-25 23:08 <Josh Lehan> And then I cashed out ALL my crap mods and low level resos
09-25 23:54 <Lance Fanger> Lol I love hearing about antics with simple seeker need to get over to his area one of these days
09-26 00:04 <Maria la Gorda> ###
09-26 00:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh around?

09-26 00:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But not as Arnold horseshack as that just sounded
09-26 18:52 <Justin Kominar> Seeker is farming the 8s in downtown.
09-26 22:42 <Christy King> Greaaaaaaaaat...  :/
09-26 23:03 <Paula E> Maria Do you still need help?

09-27 13:24 <Justin Kominar> Only 150k to go for L15 now!
09-27 13:26 <Christy King> Whoa, nice!! Go Justin!!!
09-27 13:35 <Justin Kominar> If anyone can solidify downtown further before seeker rolls through again, this would be a good time.
09-27 16:39 <Maria la Gorda> Was in LG & upgraded some stuff there & Saratoga... not much but a few
09-27 19:14 <Justin Kominar> Jenny blew it all up again anyhow
09-27 19:14 <Justin Kominar> no worries  ☺
09-27 19:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I slept all day sorry justin
09-27 23:59 <Maria la Gorda> I wish I could have slept all day :/
09-28 04:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It was cause I only got 2 hours of sleep each night this past week
09-28 04:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You're welcome to my life

09-28 14:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Jackass computer support work
09-28 14:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I need a new yob
09-28 14:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Definitely not important
09-28 14:38 <Christy King> Oh yeah, Brian does that too.
09-28 18:38 <Josh Lehan> I need more gear so will go to DTLA in a while tonight - hoping it stays up 
09-28 19:26 <Justin Kominar> My friend from Waterloo is coming to town tomorrow.  I'm hoping to take him to DTLA on Wed evening when he comes by the visit for dinner.  Hopefully it's built...  But even if not, it's a lot of uniques for him.
09-28 20:04 <Christy King> Cool!! Did he grow up in Waterloo?
09-28 20:38 <Justin Kominar> Pretty much, yeah
09-28 20:38 <Justin Kominar> London, ON technically, but has spent most of his life in the 'loo
09-29 13:35 <Zach Crawford> Check out what I did on my lunch today
09-29 13:35 <Zach Crawford> Green Los Gatos
09-29 13:38 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!

09-29 14:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thinking of visiting during my lunch

09-29 14:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Later tonight
09-29 14:21 <Christy King> Or both times!
09-29 14:22 <Christy King> Excellent plan Barbara, and very nice job Zach!
09-29 14:22 <Christy King> I retook some of the park as well, but only had a short amount of time
09-29 14:31 <Justin Kominar> Nice work Zach!
09-29 18:07 <Zach Crawford> Wagamama didn't like my lunchtime exploits and blew up Erik's. It's back to beautiful green and will be linked up again shortly.

09-29 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hrm
09-29 21:41 <Justin Kominar> I think I may go out and field over the big gap between Saratoga and LG
09-29 21:41 <Justin Kominar> Can anchor something in Campbell and cover a pretty large area.
09-29 21:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I might go farm down on lark tonight if I can then smash the shit out if it
09-29 21:57 <Christy King> I love both of these plans! Goooooo, team!
09-29 22:19 <Justin Kominar> Bingo
09-29 22:19 <Justin Kominar> Can someone screenshot Intel for me?
09-29 22:19 <Justin Kominar> Before seeker wrecks it all by hitting my home portal :)
09-29 22:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What you want screen capped?
09-29 22:28 <Christy King> ###

09-29 22:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> All good
09-29 22:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Millburray smashed it around 9, 2 link amps and jarvised it
09-29 22:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> By 910 I had all the layered fields right back up  :-)
09-29 22:43 <Justin Kominar> Sweet
09-29 22:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I threw 2 rare shields on the remaining 2 slots, good enough for this round!
09-29 22:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I live 41m from that portal though and was home when you bumped. Unless m-f 8-6 I am hone often,  I'd love to say hi and meet you

09-30 07:51 <Justin Kominar> First Baptist on Daves ave

09-30 23:48 <Maria la Gorda> PimplePeeker is such a douche
09-30 23:53 <Lance Fanger> My home portal is right by LG library if anyone wants to bump :-)
10-01 00:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah smashing up Ken and Gloria levy was freakin great
10-01 00:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do like to smite both Ken AND Gloria levy, AND their 2 kids accounts they use
10-01 00:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm just sayin
10-01 07:10 <Christy King> Hahaha Barbara!!
10-01 07:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy did you see Ken levy freaking out on josh and wendy in comms
10-01 07:37 <Christy King> Yup!
10-01 07:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hilarious
10-01 07:37 <Christy King> Palko is Josh, right?
10-01 07:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah

10-01 07:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Did you see even gil jumped in on the freaking out
10-01 07:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess he wants people to report josh and wendy for uh, having "ugly hearts"
10-01 07:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We have since then formed the first chapter of the ugly hearts club
10-01 07:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Aka team ugly hearts
10-01 10:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lololol
10-01 10:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Looks like my home portal got taken out this am by,  near as I can tell,  gloria levy herseld, bout 10 min after I left for work
10-01 10:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So let's see
10-01 10:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Trade one of their rp8 portals with very rare hack mods for my ep7 portal with some shields
10-01 10:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'll take that trade any day!
10-01 15:33 <Christy King> Nice! It's funny how the portal destruction fairy tends to visit right after you smash their stuff, isn't it?
10-01 15:34 <Justin Kominar> Yeah - seeker left an R1 on my home portal AS I was out capturing his to push me over L15 yesterday.  "Revenge" was quick with him, but it totally didn't matter  :P
10-01 15:34 <Justin Kominar> I love how he's teasing me for taking so long to get to 15 when the rest of his family are way behind me.
10-01 15:43 <Josh Lehan> Hi again 
10-01 16:36 <Christy King> Yes, he's very big on revenge attacks.
10-01 16:37 <Christy King> Hi Josh! You near the park?
10-01 17:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> To add to the lulz she didn't even smash my dinky no hack mods ep7 portal,  she threw down an ada lol
10-01 17:40 <Christy King> WOW. That is laaaaaazyyyyyy.
10-01 17:41 <Christy King> He likes to throw down adas too. They must have a ton. Probably what they use that green account for.
10-01 18:07 <Justin Kominar> Smart ENL agents save our AXA to win anomalies with.
10-01 18:07 <Justin Kominar> I LOVE it when I see them throwing them down in day to day play
10-01 18:15 <Maria la Gorda> I've been putting all of mine in red capsules. I don't have many though. Still at one digit  quantity:-(
10-01 18:29 <Christy King> Same =(
10-01 19:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm close to 40 AXAs plus another 35 VRS now
10-02 01:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 30 axa here
10-02 01:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I really need am axa cow
10-02 01:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or two

10-03 09:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah went out fielding after work
10-03 12:01 <Paula E> @maria I have 2 or 3 MUFG's I be happy to give you. I'm at Sjsu working until around 2:00. I can meet you after if you'd like.
10-03 13:41 <Justin Kominar> I have surplus mufg as well.  Happy to share
10-03 13:55 <Maria la Gorda> Awesome Paula! 
10-03 13:55 <Maria la Gorda> it's getting harder to play when i have gears in red capsules for the anomaly  :(
10-03 14:02 <Maria la Gorda> Paula, I'll have to pick them up another time... 
10-04 05:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-04 05:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ken levy came and took home and work portals,  butthurt much?
10-04 05:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> My super precious level 5 portals
10-04 05:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-04 08:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Don't mess with smeagol's precious portals!
10-04 12:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol yeah
10-04 12:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not my level 5 portals!  I'll just have to cry now
10-04 12:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not
10-04 16:47 <Lance Fanger> Lol
10-04 16:58 <Lance Fanger> Smurf a building 8s downtown
10-04 19:43 <Christy King> SimpleSmeagol?! ^_^;;
10-04 19:44 <Christy King> All of Vasona is blue... and I'm so low on bursters, I can't do much about it tomorrow. :/
10-04 21:24 <Maria la Gorda> I wasn't able to farm today  :(
10-05 12:17 <Christy King> Tomorrow (Tuesday), anyone want to hack around Vasona Park then turn it blue with me? =)
10-05 12:17 <Christy King> I'll be free around 5 or 5:30
10-05 13:10 <Maria la Gorda> Hi guys, I'm loosing my source of income, so I need to find a job within the next 2 weeks or risk being homeless. So I will be ingressing a lot less
10-05 13:10 <Maria la Gorda> just found that out this AM.
10-05 13:17 <Christy King> Oh no!!! What kind of work do you do?
10-05 13:17 <Maria la Gorda> project management, information privacy
10-05 13:18 <Christy King> You should put it out to the larger group to see if anyone knows a place hiring. You never know!
10-05 13:18 <Maria la Gorda> I'm doing that right now.
10-05 13:18 <Christy King> Good.
10-05 13:19 <Christy King> And if you need to destroy in the evenings, you are always welcome!
10-05 13:19 <Maria la Gorda> Thx!
10-05 13:20 <Christy King> Hahaha, I typed destress and my phone translated to destroy!  My phone knew what I meant!!
10-05 13:21 <Christy King> Is information privacy like HR stuff or more like computer coding Internet security stuff?
10-05 13:21 <Maria la Gorda> it's in all industries that collects personal information
10-05 13:21 <Christy King> Gotcha.
10-05 14:40 <Christy King> JCC/Legacy 6 portals were already white... and I was so close on my lunchbreak.... I couldn't help myself!
10-05 14:40 <Christy King> ###
10-05 14:41 <Christy King> SS is apparently smashing up dtlg. He'll have a little treat for later. =)
10-05 14:41 <Christy King> If anyone wants to bump it before he gets home, that will make an even better surprise!
10-05 15:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy did I tell you yet how happy you make me
10-05 17:04 <Christy King> 😆
10-05 17:08 <Christy King> Aww, JA took down my pretty portals over there. She must not have liked them. I'm shocked! 😨
10-05 17:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heheheh
10-05 22:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 3 res agents in dtlg but do they team up? God no
10-05 22:25 <Christy King> Who are they?
10-05 22:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> @millburray @destok and @inkleination
10-05 22:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Down to 2 now
10-05 22:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Destok is back up here now
10-05 22:40 <Christy King> Are you all going to the anomoly? I was gung-ho until I heard it was in Oakland. Now I'm really iffy. 😯
10-05 22:41 <Christy King> I know everybody is saying in the main chat how safe it is... but I just don't know.
10-05 22:42 <Christy King> Considering holding gear for people instead. Thoughts?
10-05 22:49 <Christy King> Am I just being paranoid??
10-06 00:29 <Maria la Gorda> The anomaly is in Oaktown???
10-06 11:56 <Christy King> Yeah. =(((
10-06 13:17 <Maria la Gorda> :-(((
10-06 13:57 <Lance Fanger> if its downtown oakland should be fine
10-06 13:57 <Lance Fanger> but make sure your in groups  ☺
10-06 20:11 <Paula E> I'm hoping it'll be fine, they're thousands of us. And it should be done before dark. I'm planning on the buddy system lol
10-07 00:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oakland is awesome, I'm gonna go
10-07 00:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Some sketchy areas sure but some totally cute little neighborhoods full of quiet tree lined streets
10-07 00:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm rather fond of oakland
10-10 00:10 <Josh Lehan> ###
10-10 09:01 <Justin Kominar> Woo!
10-10 11:00 <Christy King> Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhhhh!
10-10 22:56 <Maria la Gorda> 👍👍👍👍
10-12 07:57 <Christy King> Hmm... Should we try and do a LG thing tonight?
10-12 07:58 <Christy King> It's looking rather blue...
10-12 09:20 <Maria la Gorda> Hi, I already commitments tonight, so I will not be able to make it.
10-12 10:41 <Christy King> No worries. How's the job hunt??
10-12 12:11 <Christy King> Well hello there Maria!
10-12 12:11 <Christy King> You rock! =D
10-12 12:11 <Christy King> Want to come in and see the critters?
10-12 12:19 <Maria la Gorda> Hi Christy! I'm back home now. I was going to msg you on faction com but my phone was running low on battery. I'll let you know ahead of time next time when I'm in Vasonna next. I needed to walk in nature. It's meditation for me  ☺
10-12 12:20 <Maria la Gorda> job hunt is slow... 
10-12 12:22 <Christy King> No worries! You can always pop in the Nature Center and say hi, too. I'm usually here. Just pretend like you're a home school parent and want to schedule programs hehehe.
10-12 12:22 <Maria la Gorda> will do  ☺
10-12 12:33 <Maria la Gorda> Vasona was so beautiful this AM. not a lot of people & not too hot. At one with nature. Felt really good  ☺
10-12 15:50 <Maria la Gorda> One of my commitments got canceled tonight. I can play for an hour or so after 7:30pm
10-12 15:58 <Christy King> Check in when you're free. If it's just me, I might head out out before that. But if others are around to join in I'll probably still be here. =)
10-12 16:01 <Maria la Gorda> ok, i'll check in over Faction Comm. I don't have HO on my phone
10-12 16:04 <Christy King> Ok. Just say "@Seakay ok" and I'll say "yes" (=I'll meet you at Erik's) or "no" (=I already headed home). And smurfs like SimpleSeeker will be clueless. 😆
10-12 16:09 <Maria la Gorda> k
10-12 16:15 <Justin Kominar> clueless-er
10-12 16:46 <Christy King> Hahaha, YES, good point!!
10-12 19:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-12 19:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How do you make someone clueless even less clueless hahah
10-12 19:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This is his work portal
10-12 19:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###
10-12 19:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wanna rile him? Just go cap it every single day
10-12 19:25 <Christy King> Bwahahahaha
10-12 19:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You may wanna block him in comms if you do though
10-12 19:25 <Christy King> And then when he goes to retaliate... hit the jcc!
10-12 19:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause he'll go on and on about how you're trespassing and how he will get you in trouble for it
10-12 19:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Which of course then begs the question,  how does it ever make it over level 5
10-12 19:26 <Christy King> Right.
10-12 19:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause its only trespassing if you're on the other team? Uhhh
10-12 19:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeahhhhh, about that..
10-12 19:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Plus, don't we all know folks who work at barracuda?  I know like 7, and I like to go visit them at work :-)
10-12 19:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Point being, how does he know we -dont- know folks who work there
10-12 19:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways
10-12 19:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He's super easy to rile and I get many lulz from watching it, rile away!
10-12 19:31 <Christy King> Oh yeah! I still can't believe he got riled enough to give away his enl at account! Let's hope he keeps making stupid mistakes like that, hahaha.
10-12 19:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sure he's made another one
10-12 19:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I thanked some campbell locals for watching after my home portal while I was in sf over the weekend
10-12 19:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 10 min later he was here smashing it
10-12 19:37 <Christy King> Yup.
10-12 19:37 <Christy King> I only talk on HO now.
10-12 19:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Aye
10-12 20:12:43 *** Christy King added user 'Wendy Duvain' to conversation
10-12 20:13 <Christy King> Welcome.HolyQuail!
10-12 20:13 <Christy King> And please add Palko! Help us green up LG!! =)
10-12 20:32 <Maria la Gorda> I went home. I'm not feeling well
10-12 20:32 <Maria la Gorda> Sorry guys
10-12 21:57 <Christy King> No worries. Me too! (Went home that is)
10-12 22:06 <Wendy Duvain> Hi!
10-13 00:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Killed the gloria and Ken levy
10-13 00:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Foundation
10-13 00:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It was rp8 with those so yummy to smash very rare hack mods
10-13 00:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo
10-13 00:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then went and got the work portal
10-13 00:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Fully deployed and linked only to one other portal
10-13 00:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> My home portal
10-13 00:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bwhahahahha
10-13 00:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm so tired
10-13 00:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Night all
10-13 00:18 <Maria la Gorda> 👊👊👊👊
10-13 01:10 <Wendy Duvain> Good night
10-13 01:10:36 *** Wendy Duvain added user 'unknown_106084230584499407378' to conversation
10-13 01:10 <Wendy Duvain> This is palko
10-13 07:25 <Christy King> Hi Palko!
10-13 07:27 <Christy King> Nice Barbara! There were some juicy fields off that portal too. Bet it was a lot of ap!
10-13 09:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I fielded down to his work portal 735mu before his wife smashed it hehehe
10-13 09:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess she has to drive him to work every day lol
10-13 12:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hey,  thanks for the invite
10-13 12:58 <Justin Kominar> Hey Josh!  Welcome to the hangout.  I'm KorEldin, in game.
10-13 13:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Nice to meet you,  so you guys all playing Los Gatos?
10-13 13:01 <Justin Kominar> Pretty much.
10-13 13:01 <Justin Kominar> I live in LG, so I play around there a lot, and in Mountain View where I work.
10-13 13:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Awesome
10-13 13:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have been meaning to get over to upgrade more
10-13 13:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> There was some pretty nasty fids around lark last night but we had car trouble so we couldn't stay to take them all out
10-13 13:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Fields*
10-13 13:04 <Justin Kominar> Yeah.  I have a meeting at the Bay Club tonight at 7:30, so I'm planning on smashing anything remaining of those after that.
10-13 13:04 <Justin Kominar> That's SimpleSeeker + clan's home turf, so it's hard to keep it green, but we can at least keep it not-ultra-fielded-blue.
10-13 13:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> yeah hah
10-13 13:10 <Justin Kominar> They went AXA-crazy, so it's gonna cost me a lot of bursters, but it's definitely time for that mess to go away.
10-13 13:13 <unknown_105969224114245383430> yep, smash all the axa's, smurfs love to use all their axa shields and vr shields.  and then ada anything with an axa or vr shield on it.  I have used my pink shields around milpitas and they ada the portal, I jarvis them back and for like a few days I will spend like 10 jarvis viruses just in a virus war over a portal with an axa or vr shield, they keep ada'ing the portal and I flip it back.. they are not bad to kill if you ultra strike them, but that can be a bit time consuming 
10-13 13:14 <Justin Kominar> I'm in US8 preservation mode for December already  ☺
10-13 13:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I wish there was a badge for killing pink shields
10-13 13:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> for the anomaly? 
10-13 13:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i've noticed the smurfs love using pink and axas all over home areas and don't seem to care much about the anomaly stuff
10-13 13:16 <Justin Kominar> Yeah... for Abadon
10-13 13:16 <Justin Kominar> I accidentally dropped an AXA on my work portal today because I didn't realized I'd hacked it (normally they're MUFG'd away safely) and I felt HORRIBLE that I wasted it  ☺
10-13 13:17 <Justin Kominar> Generally, all the good stuff gets saved for the anomalies.
10-13 13:19 <Christy King> Hi Palko! I'm Seakay. I work in LG (in Vasona Park) most days, so I'm often ingressing at lunch and after work. Everyone in here lives or works in LG or comes by often.
10-13 13:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Awesome ok,  been meaning to come upgrade vasona
10-13 13:27 <Christy King> Heck yeah! I'll give you a ride in after work one night if you're here when I'm here.
10-13 13:30 <Christy King> In fact, if we want to do another group run through the park, Friday night is good for me.
10-13 13:30 <Justin Kominar> My wife's choir has a concert at Santa Clara U on Friday evening, so unfortunately I can't make it this week.
10-13 13:31 <Christy King> No worries.
10-13 13:31 <Justin Kominar> On the flip side, there's plenty of portals on campus there if anyone wants to go out  ☺
10-13 13:45 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Since you work there can you be I  the park after hours?
10-13 13:47 <unknown_105969224114245383430> And if so,  I guess my next question would be.  Could you have company with you after hours in the park if you can be heh
10-13 13:47 <unknown_105969224114245383430> In*
10-13 13:47 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Still very sleepy
10-13 13:47 <Justin Kominar> I don't get how the park can be closed in the evenings when the trail runs right through it.
10-13 13:48 <Justin Kominar> Does that mean that technically no one can be on the creek trail either?
10-13 13:48 <Justin Kominar> I get the "closed to cars" bit... but closed to all pedestrians/cyclists too?!
10-13 13:49 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Simpleseeker would love seeing us there after closing hahahha
10-13 13:51 <Christy King> Right now it's a gray area since I'm done with work well before it closes. But in the winter I'll be there after dark.
10-13 13:52 <Christy King> Probably couldn't have company that late unless it's an evening event, but could do a coordinated field op where I throw from in there on my way out.
10-13 13:52 <Christy King> Also, there's an evening event we just scheduled for 10/23 if anyone wants to sign up. It's on bats!
10-13 13:53 <Christy King> Justin, I think the trail is only open during daylight, although they don't enforce unless there's trouble.
10-13 13:54 <Christy King> And I'm gonna try to recruit a ranger... =)
10-13 13:57 <Justin Kominar> I think that's kinda lame.  It sucks that I can't ride that trail anytime.
10-13 13:57 <Justin Kominar> (and feel comfortable that I'm not in a grey zone about my right to be there)
10-13 13:58 <Christy King> I'm not certain of that. I should actually read the signs...
10-13 13:58 <Wendy Duvain> Aw seriously??
10-13 21:15 <Justin Kominar> Well, some of seekers blue is down noe
10-13 22:09 <Maria la Gorda> the Seeker family fielded over my little fields....
10-14 00:21 <Christy King> That's nice, he included you in family time, lol.
10-14 01:18 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
10-14 08:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> As for the trail I look at it this way
10-14 08:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If Google maps tells me I can take the trail at a certain time of day or night
10-14 08:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I take the trail
10-14 08:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Good work on simpletons neighborhood
10-14 08:47 <Christy King> The sign on the road says park open 8 am to sunset, trail open sunrise to sunset. But that sign isn't actually along the trail. I'll try to check that one later.
10-14 08:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Every time I've taken the trail at night I've seen others on the trail
10-14 08:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I just don't consider it trespassing
10-14 08:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug
10-14 09:20 <Christy King> Yeah, I doubt anyone cares (except SimpleMinded)
10-14 09:21 <Christy King> I'm sure it's just for liability.
10-14 09:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
10-14 09:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't pass gates or places otherwise secured and I stay off residential properties
10-14 09:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But the trail and like um, parking lots, I consider those fair game
10-14 11:09 <Christy King> Right. No gate or lock looks open to me!
10-14 11:31 <Justin Kominar> Just bring sausages for the dobermans, and you're in
!
10-14 12:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-14 12:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lace them with Valium though
10-14 12:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just to be safe
10-14 19:58 <Maria la Gorda> I saw rhmagma this evening when I was taking out The Garret Station Mural
10-14 20:03 <Maria la Gorda> Anyone in LG to talk out this portal?
https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=37.231025,-121.96489&z=17&pll=37.231025,-121.96489
10-14 21:32 <Justin Kominar> I may be able to nab it tomorrow morning on the way in to work, but I'm in for the rest of the evening now.
10-15 20:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> For what it's worth simpleton is too bust with millburray wrecking all my portals to take care of his own
10-15 20:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Smash em up
10-16 07:03 <Christy King> Let's do it tonight!!!
10-16 08:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess simpleton is fine when he wants to trespass
10-16 08:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So tired of the hypocrisy
10-16 10:10 <Christy King> I hope he moves.
10-16 10:12 <Christy King> Justin, let him know we'll throw him a Going Away Party (after he leaves, and we won't invite him, but no need to give those details.)
10-16 10:12 <Justin Kominar> hah
10-16 10:12 <Justin Kominar> Don't let him get to you ... then he's the one that's winning.
10-16 10:12 <Justin Kominar> Just keep kicking his ass.
10-16 10:12 <Justin Kominar> We have #s on our side... eventually, he'll wear down.
10-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> Although I did notice a new Simple_____ player in town yesterday.
10-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> Maybe he's had another kid?
10-16 10:13 <Christy King> Speaking of which, is anyone available to do a group attack tonight?
10-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> L4 ... 5 days old.
10-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> Has resos on the cats statues at Starbucks over by Petco
10-16 10:14 <Christy King> Oh god... Let's hope he's not reproducing anymore.
10-16 10:14 <Christy King> Well, I haven't seen JA attack stuff the last few days.
10-16 10:14 <Justin Kominar> I can't  :(   Wife has a concert in Santa Clara tonight that I'm going to, and then we're off to big basin to camp for the weekend first thing Sat morning, so I have to spend the rest of Fri evening packing stuffs.
10-16 10:14 <Christy King> Maybe OtherPeople did a name change?
10-16 10:15 <Justin Kominar> I don't think you loose your AP when you name change... just when you flip teams.
10-16 10:15 <Justin Kominar> So couldn't be OtherPeople
10-16 10:19 <Christy King> And it's not HideandSeeker?
10-16 10:20 <Christy King> I don't have keys for the Cats statues, but the keys I have around there don't have any new Seekers, just Simple and Hideand plus JA and OP, and then other names like SculpinBreath.
10-16 10:21 <Christy King> And millburray
10-16 10:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Smurfs don't get to ms esp not simpleton
10-16 10:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just life is beating me down
10-16 10:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Job is pretty messed up
10-16 10:31 <Justin Kominar> https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=37.229786,-121.980272&z=20&pll=37.229949,-121.980224
10-16 10:31 <Justin Kominar> "SimpleEnough"
10-16 10:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah who is that
10-16 10:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I keep seeing that agent name
10-16 10:35 <Christy King> Huh.
10-16 10:35 <Christy King> I haven't seen that name yet.
10-16 10:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Only playing in lg that I've seen too
10-16 10:36 <Christy King> Justin, you have good report with SS on com... maybe you should just ask if he's had another kid. =)
10-16 10:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-16 10:43 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
10-16 10:43 <Justin Kominar> I suspect it's resistance trolling us.
10-16 10:43 <Wendy Duvain> I'm sorry I'm not able to do LG tonight. Already committed to sj event a week ago yet I didn't send invite until last night
10-16 10:44 <Justin Kominar> He probably convinced someone new to sign up and knew it'd get us all worked up to see yet another "Simple*" user on the scene.
10-16 10:44 <Justin Kominar> Make us think he's cheating, etc., when he wasn't.  I wouldn't put those kind of mind games past him.
10-16 10:56 <Christy King> Well, we already know he has alts! XD
10-16 13:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yep
10-16 13:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And we know he lies so
10-18 14:51 <Wendy Duvain> Simple and family were at oak yesterday
10-18 14:52 <Wendy Duvain> Oak will flip back to green :)
10-18 14:52 <Wendy Duvain> Oak Hill
10-18 17:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We are building oak Hill right now.  It will be 4 or 3 away from l8
10-18 17:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If anyone needs some gear and close by oak Hill closes at sunset
10-18 17:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It might be 3 away from eight after Wendy and I deploy
10-18 17:37 <Christy King> Simple and Jenny have definitely taken a liking to Oak Hill lately.
10-18 17:38 <Christy King> Let us know on here if/when they're attacking it (or elsewhere), and hopefully someone can scoot over to the jcc to attack undefended portals!
10-18 17:39 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ok,
10-18 17:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Oak Hill is a fun farm :o
10-18 17:44 <Christy King> It is! It's a bit far from LG so I've only made it once so far, but I'll be back! Next time I'll bring a printout of the loop to make it easier. =)
10-18 17:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> The top of the high is l8
10-18 17:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hill*

10-18 23:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Of I had energy or q car I'd go lake out lark ave tonight
10-18 23:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> :)
10-19 08:14 <Justin Kominar> Bluefish:  left a couple keys for my home portals at yours this a.m.  Hopefully you can grab them before someone else.
10-19 09:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omfg I love keys
10-19 09:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I totally got em all
10-19 09:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thank you thank you thank you!
10-19 09:26 <Justin Kominar> Awesome.  I tried to finish the field from your portal to mine this morning, but yours was at max links already  :(  
10-19 09:26 <Justin Kominar> If it's still standing when I get home, I'll do it then now that I have another key for yours.
10-19 09:27 <Justin Kominar> I also have more of those keys, but I didn't want to drop TOO many in case you weren't the one that actually grabbed them.
10-19 09:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Keys on the ground nearby will often motivate me to leave the house
10-19 09:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm a total key whore
10-19 10:30 <Justin Kominar> ok .. next time I'll ping you before I leave.  I kinda just dropped by on a whim this morning hoping that I could complete that field.
10-19 12:50 <Josh Lehan> Hi again
10-19 12:51 <Josh Lehan> It is October which means haunted house in park which means it is legally open at night :)
10-19 13:09 <Justin Kominar> Actually, I've heard that they are not doing the goblin's glen at Oak Meadow this year
10-19 13:10 <Justin Kominar> Our scout pack leader just told me that while we were planning the pack halloween party.
10-19 14:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Doublety - kehalla has storage over by the pet memorial
10-19 14:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We're boned on that one
10-19 15:06 <Josh Lehan> Pooh :( the haunted house got cancelled this year?
10-19 15:06 <Josh Lehan> Have to wait for Fantasy Of Lights then!
10-19 18:03 <Christy King> I'll be in Vasona after dark most nights once the time changes, though I'll only be able to get the ones by YSI.
10-19 18:04 <Christy King> Miss Pezcado, I am cracking UP!! I can only see your side of the conversation, though. Please post the full thing if you can, it looks hilaaaaaarious!!! LOL
10-19 18:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Move the chat to 50 you can see what he is saying to her.  He is by red wood city
10-19 18:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Also dude is pretty rude
10-19 19:19 <Zach Crawford> Someone blew up the Erik's below my work so I decided to turn my little piece of Los Gatos green as a little payback. 
10-19 19:28 <Zach Crawford> Now I'm going to try to walk around JCC and blow stuff up for good measure. 
10-19 19:29 <Christy King> Hehehe
10-19 19:30 <Christy King> I too meandered about LG Blvd, and made some blue turn green. And linked. And fielded. And 😆
10-19 19:50 <Zach Crawford> Made him use an Ada
10-19 19:50 <Christy King> Hahaha
10-19 19:57 <Zach Crawford> Put a link through his living room
10-19 19:57 <Zach Crawford> I bet he can smell it
10-19 20:13 <Christy King> Aaaaaaahahahaha!!!!!
10-19 20:14 <Christy King> That is downright AWESOME.
10-19 20:15 <Zach Crawford> I think I just fielded over his house
10-19 20:16 <Zach Crawford> ###
10-19 20:17 <Christy King> Oh, he's probably steaming!! Love it!! Keep going!!!
10-19 20:19 <Christy King> Oh poo. I was in the middle of attacking earlier and geocery shopping, and now the comm won't go back that far.
10-19 20:21 <Christy King> Simple is out attacking my handiwork. Meaning, he's not at the jcc... 😆
10-19 20:26 <Zach Crawford> He took out Office Depot so I took it back and fielded over his house again
10-19 20:26 <Christy King> Yessssssssssssss!!!
10-19 20:31 <Zach Crawford> He blew up Office Depot again 
10-19 20:31 <Zach Crawford> So I took it back again
10-19 20:31 <Zach Crawford> He finally realized that he should have blown up the portal by his house. 
10-19 20:31 <Zach Crawford> Cuz I'm out of XMPs
10-19 20:33 <Zach Crawford> Oh wait, he didn't
10-19 20:33 <Zach Crawford> Third times a charm
10-19 20:36 <Zach Crawford> Boom Goes the dynamite
10-19 20:42 <Zach Crawford> Lol! He did it again. I've gotten well over 1000 mu thanks to him. 
10-19 20:54 <Zach Crawford> Well that's all for tonight folks. I think fielding over his house 3 times in one night was good enough for me. 
10-19 20:56 <Wendy Duvain> Like a bosa
10-19 20:56 <Wendy Duvain> Good job
10-19 22:09 <Josh Lehan> Nice fields! I was busy today but got out enough to upgrade stuff near the corner of LG Blvd and BH Road.
10-19 23:02 <Christy King> Damn Zach, you da MAN!!

10-20 13:39 <Zach Crawford> I won't be able to stay in town tonight to green it back up but maybe tomorrow. 
10-20 13:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> if work stops throwing me in meetings I can go green stuff up. 
10-20 14:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> @zach are you out of xmp

10-20 15:52 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Well, he's about half a block from me eating my resos lol
10-20 16:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lark ave is free to smash he's busy trespassing at my job
10-20 16:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have a job and cannot

10-20 16:21 <Justin Kominar> Sweet!
10-20 16:22 <Justin Kominar> That's a good field between you and I, and it's gonna be annoying for him to keep blockers up to prevent.  
10-20 16:22 <Justin Kominar> We'll have to keep the keys flowing so we can try and keep that thing up all the time.
10-20 16:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Indeed!
10-20 17:48 <Christy King> Does the field go over his favorite portals?
10-20 17:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Already blown up followed by his underemployed ass heading straight to my work portals
10-20 17:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
10-20 17:50 <Christy King> Well, he's nothing of not consistent...
10-20 17:51 <Christy King> Next time we get a group together, we can have one team do things like that field to distract him, then another team hit lark Ave while he's out, hehehe.
10-20 17:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> YES!!!!
10-20 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wendy fwiw I can't control how often Google let's me change the name on my account I'm sorry it brought you to tears

10-20 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry for drama backing off now
10-20 18:54 <Christy King> No drama in this one! All rants should be about SimpleMinded and his band of cronies, haha.
10-20 18:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yup yup

10-20 22:14 <Maria la Gorda> Is the food good there Justin?
10-20 22:16 <Maria la Gorda> $210 for tasting menu! 
10-20 22:16 <Maria la Gorda> I think TJ's was less expensive

10-21 20:04 <Christy King> By the way, if anyone else wants to do a key-drop lunch in LG one day, just let me know. I can collect some Vasona keys for you. =)
10-21 20:15 <Justin Kominar> Nice work Zac!  I helped out with that a little tiny smidge while I was out picking up groceries  ☺
10-21 20:17 <Christy King> Sweet! I made some fields to and in Vasona, but they are tiny. Those fields on the right of the pic are huge!
10-21 20:17 <Christy King> Gooooooo, team!!
10-21 21:23 <Maria la Gorda> Went to build the farm in Sunnyvale to get gears & the smurfs showed up  :(
10-21 21:25 <Wendy Duvain> People are discussing a mole
10-21 21:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Oh yeah in what chat?
10-21 21:25 <Wendy Duvain> We are trying to figure out who has been leaking
10-21 21:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Did you get my messages?
10-21 21:25 <Maria la Gorda> Tara said that the smurfs usually show up on Wednesday night in Sunnyvale
10-21 21:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We are good to go for blockers
10-21 22:21 <Christy King> How many smurfs showed up?? :/
10-21 22:21 <Maria la Gorda> an army
10-21 22:23 <Maria la Gorda> 1st it was killbowls
10-21 22:23 <Maria la Gorda> I think it was a many smurfs were there as there were frogs.
10-21 22:26 <Wendy Duvain> No this was a leak
10-21 22:26 <Wendy Duvain> Every farm for past few weeks have been leaked
10-21 22:26 <Wendy Duvain> The Wed farms
10-21 22:26 <Wendy Duvain> We are trying to figure out who.
10-22 07:04 <Christy King> Poop!
10-22 07:05 <Christy King> It wasn't me! I'm out Wednesdays because I do Search and Rescue and that's when we meet.
10-22 07:06 <Christy King> Maybe set up a fake farm and only tell some people about it?
10-22 07:48 <Christy King> Or make another HO just for people you've seen playing and know are legit in the fight against smurfs. Tell them a real build, and then announce a fake build in the big HO. If that goes well, keep adding folks to your Cool People HO one by one and testing.
10-22 08:15 <Wendy Duvain> I agree. I'm going to make a dummy one
10-22 10:35 <Josh Lehan> @Christy Scrolled up in scrollback but did not see those potential desk portals listed, did I miss them? 
10-22 10:37 <Josh Lehan> Is there still space for that bat walk on Friday night? It will drive Seeker batty! 
10-22 11:04 <Christy King> Josh, I think Pezcado posted them? I don't remember what it was, but maybe Justin knows?
10-22 11:04 <Maria la Gorda> Who's the smurf CrankyFool? It took out the Vasona Clock Tower
10-22 11:04 <Christy King> Yes,.there is still space! You should totally come!
10-22 11:04 <Christy King> Hahaha, drive him batty! I just saw that.
10-22 11:05 <Christy King> Maria, I haven't seen that name before... but I must say, props to him on the name, haha.
10-22 11:05 <Maria la Gorda> he should change it to CrankySmurf LOL
10-22 11:27 <Christy King> Well, smurf = fool.
10-22 11:28 <Justin Kominar> I believe she suggested he worked at Barracuda, on Winchester.
10-22 11:29 <Justin Kominar> There's some lame art-deco painting portal inside the lobby of the building, there iirc
10-22 11:31 <Wendy Duvain> Smurf = fool.... Lol
10-22 11:31 <Wendy Duvain> Yeah he works at barracuda
10-22 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> And he's quick to get on your case if you drive into parking lot to deploy
10-22 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> I just ignore his comms
10-22 11:32 <Christy King> Are there signs posted that you cant?
10-22 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> He makes ingress annoying.
10-22 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> There are always signs on parking lots
10-22 11:32 <Christy King> He blocked me on comm because I told him to chill once.
10-22 11:33 <Wendy Duvain> He only claims he's blocking. It's "pretend"  blocking.
10-22 11:33 <Wendy Duvain> He's still reading faction comms with alt enl account or mole.
10-22 11:33 <Christy King> And because he couldn't talk to me through SimpleSeeker, he messaged me.from his at account like a DUMB ASS
10-22 11:33 <Josh Lehan> Thanks will register for it today
10-22 12:16 <Maria la Gorda> Smurf tears @christy
10-22 12:16 <Maria la Gorda> he gets reunited with his smurf tears & gets butt hurt
10-22 12:17 <Christy King> The lake in Vasona is full of smurf tears!!!
10-22 12:18 <Christy King> ...and goose poop. Both are nasty. Never swim here.
10-22 13:51 <Christy King> Woohoo, Josh is signed up for tomorrow!
10-22 13:56 <Wendy Duvain> I have tutoring :(
10-22 13:56 <Wendy Duvain> Vasona Lake is borne of smurf tears :)
10-22 14:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> What is tomorrow
10-22 14:09 <Christy King> Oh sorry, let me copy my post over
10-22 14:13 <Christy King> Hey, for all you fellow creatures of the night, we have a "Secret World of Bats" science safari tomorrow night that still has space. Led by a world-renowned expert. Recommended for ages 7+ but you don't have to have kids to go. It's at Vasona Park tomorrow night, and includes an indoor presentation and a night walk to see and hear bats (he has something that lets you hear bat frequencies). ...Side note, you'd be legitimately in Vasona Park after closing time, and there are many portals there! Register at www.youthscience.org (scroll down to see Science Safaris link)
10-22 14:13 <Christy King> By the way, it's the other Josh that signed for this. Krellan. =)
10-22 14:15 <Wendy Duvain> Omg
10-22 14:15 <Wendy Duvain> I wanna do that
10-22 14:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> The link brings me to another site
10-22 14:15 <Wendy Duvain> I can pretend to be a kid
10-22 14:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You are a kid
10-22 14:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Link brings me to http://www.ysi-ca.org/
10-22 14:16 <Christy King> Yeah its the same site
10-22 14:16 <Wendy Duvain> Heh I wish
10-22 14:16 <Christy King> Just changes names
10-22 14:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ok
10-22 14:16 <Wendy Duvain> Wish I had time to make an Alice dress :D
10-22 14:17 <Christy King> You don't have to be a kid.
10-22 14:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Alice dress to look at bats?
10-22 14:17 <Christy King> We get adults signing up.for this one without kids all the time! It's just that cool.
10-22 14:18 <Wendy Duvain> Bc I'm weird yo
10-22 14:19 <Christy King> Alice in winderland, Alice the housekeeper from Brady Bunch, Alice in Chains,.xombo of all 3 (lol)...?
10-22 14:19 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm working tomorrow night also I work most nights
10-22 14:20 <Christy King> Wendy, if you tutor kids about biology, you could count this as research...
10-22 14:20 <Wendy Duvain> ###
10-22 15:19 <Christy King> Jenny's on the move...
10-22 15:19 <Christy King> Bye bye, Giant Clock on Lark.
10-22 17:26 <Christy King> Ugh. Seeker family trip through the park. They were apparently right outside my work. Yuckkkkk.
10-22 17:33 <Maria la Gorda> Assuming HideNSeeker is a mini simpleseeker?
10-22 17:35 <Zach Crawford> I saw all my beautiful Vasona links go down. It made me sad. 
10-22 17:35 <Christy King> Don't worry, I'm on it. =)
10-22 17:36 <Zach Crawford> Cool
10-22 17:36 <Christy King> Maria, yes, it sounds like he has 2 or 3 offspring
10-22 17:38 <Christy King> Great. He just put up a shitload on links going across so I can't link the park up. Anyone have a few minutes for a drive through the park with me?
10-22 17:39 <Zach Crawford> On the way now
10-22 17:40 <Christy King> Wtf. He came back in the park and neutralized as I was dropping resonators.
10-22 17:40 <Zach Crawford> Which entrance should I go to?
10-22 17:40 <Christy King> New plan: KILL LEGACY & JCC.
10-22 17:40 <Christy King> Then I can pick you up at back gate.
10-22 17:41 <Zach Crawford> If he uses an axa, leave it. I have 2 Jarvis
10-22 17:41 <Christy King> I think I see him. White car with American flag on the side.
10-22 17:41 <Zach Crawford> On the way to the back
10-22 17:41 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hah
10-22 17:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Kill all axas
10-22 17:42 <Christy King> He parked 2 spots away from me!
10-22 17:42 <Zach Crawford> Well if you have the hardware then why not
10-22 17:44 <Christy King> Hrs heading further into the park. Hit jcc, HARD. Go go go!!
10-22 17:44 <Zach Crawford> Ok
10-22 17:46 <Zach Crawford> Starting at the corner
10-22 17:46 <Christy King> I'm seeing 3 common and 1 rare shield in each
10-22 17:46 <Christy King> So maybe he's out of axas. =)
10-22 17:49 <Christy King> Zach, you getting recharged on?
10-22 17:49 <Christy King> All 4 are in the car so they can't deploy at home bwahaha
10-22 17:55 <Zach Crawford>  Yeah, they tried to recharge
10-22 17:55 <Zach Crawford> Didn't work
10-22 17:56 <Zach Crawford> I'm walking to get the best accuracy
10-22 17:58 <Christy King> They walked right by me, hahaha
10-22 17:58 <Maria la Gorda> x_x
10-22 17:58 <Maria la Gorda> Did they say anything?
10-22 17:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You should record them
10-22 17:59 <Christy King> Nope. I made a real call just before to brian, so they thought I was just a gal on the phone
10-22 17:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Like they do to us
10-22 17:59 <Maria la Gorda> But the seeker dude knows what you look like by now, no ?
10-22 18:00 <Christy King> Not sure
10-22 18:00 <Christy King> They thought Brian was Seakay apparently
10-22 18:01 <Justin Kominar> Heading home now.. gonna close up those fields I left in the morning between Saratoga and my home portal, provided you guys can keep them busy enough that he doesn't go pop my portal  ☺
10-22 18:02 <Christy King> It was a loooovely day in the park! Wanna see?
10-22 18:02 <Christy King> ###
10-22 18:02 <Christy King> They are on foot, mid park, so you've got some time
10-22 18:02 <Christy King> Though I can't stay long
10-22 18:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hahahaha
10-22 18:06 <Maria la Gorda> it's too bad I can't zoom
10-22 18:07 <Christy King> Can someone pull up Intel and tell me where all those links are coming from?
10-22 18:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ok from the park?
10-22 18:08 <Zach Crawford> How you like JCC now?
10-22 18:09 <Zach Crawford> JCC all done. Now seeing if I can field over his house
10-22 18:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
10-22 18:10 <Maria la Gorda> ###
10-22 18:10 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
10-22 18:11 <Maria la Gorda> There's a long link that goes through Vasona from this portal
10-22 18:11 <Maria la Gorda> https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=37.259299,-121.947038&z=17&pll=37.259299,-121.947038
10-22 18:11 <Zach Crawford> Linked it back to the damn
10-22 18:11 <Maria la Gorda> to this portal
10-22 18:11 <Christy King> Aww, they're from ysi aren't they?

10-22 18:12 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
10-22 18:12 <unknown_105969224114245383430> That is the one that shoots to bascom
10-22 18:13 <Christy King> I have to head out, but if you go to the back gate and hit the ones around ysi, that should take out most links.
10-22 18:14 <Christy King> This was fun!!
10-22 18:16 <Zach Crawford> Yeah it was!
10-22 18:17 <Brian Wiebe> Nice job Zach lookin good
10-22 18:22 <Christy King> Soooo many keys!!! Lol Zach is this you?
10-22 18:22 <Christy King> ###
10-22 18:27 <Zach Crawford> I'm going to go get that long link
10-22 18:28 <Zach Crawford> Then use it to cover his house
10-22 18:31 <Maria la Gorda> Who's OtherPeople? Another Seeker's kid?
10-22 18:31 <Wendy Duvain> Yeah
10-22 18:32 <Wendy Duvain> They keep multiplying
10-22 18:32 <Maria la Gorda> well, at least we know what they do LOL

10-22 18:37 <Christy King> One more intel pic please
10-22 18:37 <Zach Crawford> I'm out for he weekend now. Good luck!
10-22 18:47 <Brian Wiebe> ###
10-22 18:49 <Maria la Gorda> ###
10-22 18:55 <Christy King> ###
10-22 18:55 <Christy King> I couldn't help myself...
10-22 19:11 <Wendy Duvain> Lol hey it was friendly :)
10-22 20:04 <Christy King> Right!
10-23 09:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Lol!  I just realized the guy leading the bat thing tonight is one of the scientists I work with!  Tell him Liza says hello. 
10-23 09:50 <Wendy Duvain> What is your work Liza?
10-23 09:53 <unknown_105969224114245383430> 
10-23 09:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's a great company :)
10-23 09:54 <Wendy Duvain> Omg ecology????
10-23 09:55 <Wendy Duvain> I've been dying to work in environmental industry but hasn't been working out for me.
10-23 09:55 <Wendy Duvain> Now I'm getting closer to tech
10-23 09:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It can be tricky. Right now we need Landscape Architects.  It all varies on the projects we get in. 
10-23 09:57 <Wendy Duvain> Certainly tricky
10-23 09:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Working here makes me wanna go back to school and get some kind of GIS degree. Mapping is huge in everything. 
10-23 09:59 <Wendy Duvain> Oh yeah gis... I meant to learn that but no motivation yet.
10-23 09:59 <Maria la Gorda> My friend from back home has a GIS degree 
10-23 10:00 <Maria la Gorda> He worked for the government for a bit drawing maps
10-23 10:12 <Wendy Duvain> I had an interview with a company working for Santa Clara County doing field work in Los Gatos but then I got this Google contractor job first 😭
10-23 10:12 <Josh Lehan> I am going to the bat thing tonight 
10-23 10:19 <Maria la Gorda> Wendy, go after what you want.
10-23 10:23 <Maria la Gorda> right after I accepted a position, the company I really wanted to work for & the job I wanted called me. Because I just accepted the position, I felt obliged to stay. I would do things differently now.
10-23 10:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I switch careers every few years.  I took a couple GIS classes and think it's great.  I could do that for a bit for sure.  
10-23 10:35 <Christy King> Oh how funny!! I'll tell Dave hi for you. =)
10-23 10:37 <Christy King> Josh, do you have keys for around the park, esp the Lark side? If not, you should hack before you come in. You could make some links tonight! =D
10-23 10:38 <Christy King> Also, thanks to Seeker fam linking everything to YSI and the dam, I got 47,499ap this morning on my way in to work, just by hitting 4 portals and recharging another one!!
10-23 10:38 <Justin Kominar> woot
10-23 11:15 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!
10-23 11:16 <Justin Kominar> Don't one-up me with !'s... that game can turn nasty, fast.
10-23 11:16 <Justin Kominar> woot!!!
10-23 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> woot!
10-23 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!!
10-23 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> that's the one I like
10-23 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> so it's need 3 exclamation point after woot
10-23 11:17 <Maria la Gorda> oh no you didn't!!!
10-23 11:17 <Maria la Gorda> LMAO!!
10-23 11:18 <Maria la Gorda> /PITCHFORKS
10-23 11:19 <Maria la Gorda> ok, gotta go  ☺
10-23 11:19 <Justin Kominar> There you go
10-23 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
10-23 12:06 <Christy King> Hahahahaha!
10-23 12:06 <Christy King> I'd say woot!!!!
10-23 12:07 <Christy King> One ! for each 10,000 ap, hehehe
10-23 13:26 <Maria la Gorda> Hey Christy! I have to be at an event in Saratoga at 6:45pm. What time can I come pick up the donated gear?
10-23 13:36 <Christy King> Might have to do a raincheck... I used a bunch yesterday. Brian has some though and might be in LG tonight... Let me follow up.
10-23 14:09 <Justin Kominar> Greening things up I'm Campbell Saratoga atm
10-23 14:30 <Justin Kominar> There we go.  Nice and green
10-23 14:53 <Christy King> Josh is going to the event tonight. I'm off the clock just before it starts, but might stick around anyways, and maybe get Brian too. Are there others around that can hit Lark Ave and around so we have places to link to? 😊
10-23 14:57 <Josh Lehan> Maximize keys obtained in park so can throw inward for fields later
10-23 15:01 <Christy King> Josh, if you have time to hit Oak Meadow by the way, I loosened it up for you with lots of bursters in vaaona
10-23 17:32 <Wendy Duvain> Have a last minute thing to do tonight... Can't do bats anymore
10-23 18:01 <Christy King> Boo!!!
10-23 18:02 <Christy King> You'd have to register to come, and I haven't seen your name pop up so I figured not coming... but I hoped!
10-23 18:03 <Christy King> On a side note, the newts here are particularly adorable right now..:-)
10-23 18:03 <Christy King> ###
10-23 18:46 <Josh Lehan> ###
10-23 18:46 <Josh Lehan> Note sign in middle 
10-23 18:47 <Christy King> Hehehe
10-23 18:47 <Christy King> ###
10-23 19:23 <Wendy Duvain> Cute
10-23 20:05 <Josh Lehan> ###
10-23 20:24 <Christy King> As predicted, SimpleSeeker is crapping himself RIGHT NOW.
10-23 20:24 <Christy King> ###
10-23 20:27 <Christy King> ###
10-23 20:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hahaha
10-23 20:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Tell him you can report people for saying they are going to report you
10-23 20:30 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I totally found it in tos and thought of him
10-23 20:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Did he say anything else
10-23 20:36 <Christy King> Not a word.
10-23 20:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Damn I wanted to reply
10-23 20:38 <Christy King> He said awhile back that he blocked me but I'm sure he can see it with his alts, or his family's accounts
10-23 20:38 <Christy King> You should message him and say Hi! Tell him what a *winner* he is.
10-23 20:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Blocking only makes it so you can't see people chT not actions I'm the game
10-23 20:39 <Christy King> Right. He might not have seen my message. But I'm sure he saw all the links I made right after, lol.
10-23 21:00 <Wendy Duvain> That is fucking awesome
10-23 21:00 <Wendy Duvain> He mad
10-23 21:00 <Wendy Duvain> I want to see him call the cops
10-23 21:04 <Justin Kominar> Oh man - what a jackass he is.
10-23 21:04 <Justin Kominar> Like, take a pill already, seeker
10-23 21:50 <Christy King> Best part is that one of the rangers came with us. And also might join the game. Hehehe
10-23 21:51 <Christy King> I told him before to take a chill pill...
10-23 21:51 <Christy King> That's when he blocked me! Lol
10-23 21:57 <Josh Lehan> That would be really cool if that cute ranger guy also joins us
10-23 21:59 <Christy King> ❤❤  Oooooohhhhhhhhh ❤❤
10-23 21:59 <Christy King> Josh made a new friend!!
10-23 21:59 <Christy King> Happy birthday to YOU!!
10-23 22:03 <Josh Lehan> :) Cool thanks!
10-23 22:05 <Christy King> Before
10-23 22:05 <Christy King> ###
10-23 22:06 <Christy King> After
10-23 22:06 <Christy King> ###
10-23 22:13 <Josh Lehan> Nice
10-23 22:15 <Christy King> Simpleton got mad and put a big blue field over the park, from his home portal. I didn't have time to play portal tug-o-war so I did a drive by jarvis-bomb.
10-23 22:24 <Brian Wiebe> Nice job wifey!
10-24 00:37 <Christy King> He *just* took back Legacy Church! Took him long enough, haha
10-24 01:03 <Maria la Gorda> XD
10-25 17:55 <Maria la Gorda> Christy, I was only able to smash 2 portals at Calero. Cell cignal there is bad unfortunately. It goes in & out.
10-25 17:56 <Christy King> No worries, I'm sure it helped!
10-25 17:56 <Maria la Gorda> Additionally, the one I didn't have time to smash, I had to hike to & my dad was with me & was getting pissed
10-25 17:57 <Christy King> Haha, no worries!
10-25 18:01 <Maria la Gorda> is LittleDhampir one of Seeker's kids?
10-25 18:23 <Christy King> Not that I know of
10-26 13:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Christy or Brian question about last night at the Alviso wetlands.  I found the form to apply for a key.  But it seems they want a vehicle license number.  And a boat one.  Also why your there and all that.  I'd I don't have the info is it still possible to get one?
10-26 13:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
10-26 13:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Also there is a annual fee
10-26 13:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> But no info on how much
10-26 13:30 <Christy King> Brian, all you. I don't know permits.
10-26 14:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> there is an option for 'wildlife viewing' i wonder if that would be ok to just pick that option only. 
10-26 14:27 <Josh Lehan> Keep in mind that frogs are natural in riparian habitats but smurfs are not :)
10-26 17:03 <Brian Wiebe> @Josh, I'm not sure. Probably should have one as it makes the permit look like a normal request. I'm not sure on the costs though.
10-26 17:04 <Brian Wiebe> I think you could pick wilelife viewing as the reason for the permit. You might want to be able to view the nighttime inhabitants and need after-hours access 😊
10-26 17:05 <unknown_105969224114245383430> whats the place I can call to ask about it? I forgot the name 
10-26 17:29 <Christy King> Santa Clara County Parks
10-26 17:30 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I will call them tomorrow, thanks
10-26 18:45 <Josh Lehan> Any fun goings-on tonight?
10-26 18:55 <Christy King> I did a little fielding in Vasona
10-26 18:56 <Christy King> And I was gonna head out, but I could stick around for a little longer if you wanna hang out
10-26 19:00:07 *** Christy King added user 'Dave Marshall' to conversation
10-26 19:00 <Christy King> This is Couch Farmer. Passes through LG for commute. =)
10-26 19:00 <Dave Marshall> Hola all :)
10-26 19:05 <Christy King> 15min  south is a pkg lot.
10-26 19:05 <Christy King> 17 south
10-26 19:48 <Josh Lehan> Just curious, doing stuff for work then will be free later, maybe DTLA if not here
10-26 20:07 <Justin Kominar> Greetings Dave!
10-26 20:07 <Justin Kominar> KorEldin here.
10-26 23:06 <Maria la Gorda> Hi Dave! I'm agent Maria la Gorda
10-27 00:25 <Lance Fanger> Hey dave tapitipuku here
10-27 12:51 <Christy King> I'm Seakay. And my husband Brian (who's busy at work right now) is BW13B3.
10-27 13:10 <Dave Marshall> Hey everyone - I live in Cambrian and usually commute down 85 in the evenings.
10-27 14:41 <Maria la Gorda> Done! I took down the link from Calero & capped the portal. I ran 1/4 mile to get to the portal. my glutes are happy :-)
10-27 14:54 <Christy King> JennyAppleseed came to the park today, and started attacking portals near YSI... but we had a bunch of groups of kids that all emerged from programs right then, and I think we scared her off! Yesssss!!! Hahaha
10-27 16:13 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
10-27 17:43 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
10-27 21:24 <Josh Lehan> Cool re YSI - busy but productive day at work for me 
10-28 13:01 <Maria la Gorda> Went for a run this AM, & took out the last 2 portals at the top of the hill
10-28 14:03 <Zach Crawford> Wow!!! Nice run!
10-28 14:03 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Zach! KB took them out & fielded from one of the lower portals
10-28 14:04 <Maria la Gorda> ###
10-28 16:32 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Is there a farm tonight?
10-28 17:34 <Christy King> I think Tara is coordinating one, but I don't know the details cuz I can't go.
10-28 17:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ok
10-29 20:13 <Josh Lehan> ###
10-29 20:13 <Josh Lehan> Earlier tonite at JCC
10-29 20:38 <Christy King> Hehehe, nice!
10-29 20:49 <Brian Wiebe> Ya!
10-29 20:49 <Maria la Gorda> 👊🐸
10-29 21:25 <Josh Lehan> Did not use a single burster, the portals were white when I came
10-29 21:25 <Josh Lehan> Seeker gets more riled up when I use 0 bursters than if I were to use 1000 bursters
10-29 22:10 <Justin Kominar> I smashed that in passing, Josh  ☺
10-29 22:10 <Justin Kominar> Couldn't deploy in time though.
10-29 22:26 <Lance Fanger> Nice work
10-29 22:27 <Lance Fanger> Simple getting all riled up about people playing from their cars again boy is that guy excitable
10-29 22:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> heh
10-29 22:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> screen shots please
10-29 22:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i wanna make a poster with all his sayings
10-29 22:43 <unknown_105969224114245383430> still to this day my favorite is:  

 I've never had to trespass for a victory
10-29 23:44 <Christy King> It's funny, because simple also plays from his car. Sometimes the whole family plays from the car. I've seen them!
10-30 15:04 <Josh Lehan> Finally had a light day at work and so could take a walk 
10-30 15:05 <Josh Lehan> Vasona middle loop is nicely built 
10-30 15:05 <Josh Lehan> Got really keyscrewed so left lots of V-shapes waiting you to cash them in for fields 
10-30 15:06 <Josh Lehan> Fantasy Of Lights is going up! Seeker will wet the bed about nighttime access. 
10-30 15:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> excellent. 
10-30 15:08 <Josh Lehan> Maybe later will do the train loop or the YSI loop - park nicely divides into three loops 
10-30 15:17 <Christy King> Nice Josh!! =)
10-30 15:18 <Christy King> If you come do the YSI loop, I can give you some keys to elsewhere in the park.
10-30 15:19 <Christy King> And feel free to throw those "junk" hack mods on the ones around YSI and Circle Lot. I'll make use of them. =)
10-30 15:19 <Christy King> Around playground and Oak Meadow is good too, since people hang out there.
10-30 15:20 <Christy King> And it's not like shields do much to stop SS anyways, haha.
10-30 15:31 <Josh Lehan> Hack mods were deployed near Pier Lot which is as close as I came 
10-30 15:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Brain are you able to hit drawbridge this weekend or was it last weekend when you guys had your thing at alviso
10-30 16:27 <Christy King> It's NEXT weekend, Nov 7.
10-30 17:15 <Wendy Duvain> Where is the screenshot of tears from simple again?
10-30 17:15 <Wendy Duvain> About victory
10-30 17:16 <Maria la Gorda> who posted it?
10-30 17:33 <Wendy Duvain> Can't remember
10-30 18:20 <Christy King> Was that Palko?
10-30 18:21 <Christy King> I think that was in SJ chat?
10-30 19:05 <Christy King> Haha, who linked to Vasona the same time I was linking to Eriks? That was great!
10-30 19:05 <Josh Lehan> Hi from Erik's. Bumped it to 7.
10-30 19:07 <Christy King> I thought that might be you! Hi!!
10-30 19:08 <Christy King> Nicely done in Vasona today!!
10-30 19:12 <Brian Wiebe> Yes. Good job, the park is looking pretty good
10-30 19:13 <Josh Lehan> Thanks although I did not throw that link :) bad luck with keys, remember? 
10-30 19:13 <Josh Lehan> Thanks for fixing it up 
10-30 19:13 <Josh Lehan> How are things tonight - I am debating going home or going out for food or whatever 
10-30 19:15 <Christy King> Oh, it was my pleasure. =D
10-30 19:16 <Christy King> Brian and I were gonna go eat at Plutos in Santana Row. Wanna meet us there? (Sandwiches and a really good salad bar... and garlic fries)
10-30 19:18 <Christy King> And there are a TON of portals around there
10-30 19:21 <Josh Lehan> Thanks - maybe will check it out - last time I tried to go to SR could not park anywhere and had to leave 
10-30 19:39 <Brian Wiebe> Best place to park is across the street at the old Winchester theaters parking lot
10-30 19:49 <Josh Lehan> Thanks - did not know they let you do that now 
10-30 19:50 <Wendy Duvain> Santana row looking so grern
10-30 19:50 <Wendy Duvain> I'm thinking of holding sjcc build again soon
10-30 20:04 <Josh Lehan> When were you going to that place Pluto's?
10-30 20:05 <Josh Lehan> Pooh, they knocked down Erik's and took all fields
10-30 20:13 <Josh Lehan> I actually found parking(!!) so will hang out at SR for a bit
10-30 20:17 <Christy King> We just got to SR Josh. Going to Plutos now. 😊
10-30 20:17 <Christy King> Wendy, soon as in tonight, or soon when? SJ Community center?
10-30 20:19 <Josh Lehan> Cool will go there now
10-30 20:30 <Justin Kominar> I greened up most of downtown this eve, if anyone wants to buff it up more
10-30 20:31 <Justin Kominar> Although, it does appear that seeker and wife are out for a night on the town taking it all back now
10-30 20:34 <Christy King> Well they can't take back the park until tomorrow, unless they *gasp* TRESSPASS.
10-30 20:37 <Justin Kominar> *dum *dum* *dummmmmmmmm*
10-30 20:42 <Lance Fanger> Lol
10-30 20:49 <Justin Kominar> Lance, do you live downtown?  You seem to play around that area the most.
10-31 00:01 <Lance Fanger> Very close I live right behind the library
10-31 02:10 <unknown_105969224114245383430> West valley college is going smurf eight looks like simpleseeker is there
10-31 09:44 <Maria la Gorda> Hello Los Gatos residents! Do you know where I can park at West Valley College if I don't have a parking permit?
10-31 09:48 <Wendy Duvain> Paula might know
10-31 09:48 <Maria la Gorda> I texted her
10-31 10:38 <Christy King> I don't know. Maybe near the admissions office??
10-31 11:26 <Paula E> Sorry for the delay under the weather again
10-31 11:26 <Paula E> I've always just parked wherever and never gotten a ticket. Because t if you want to be safe you can park at the LDS church on allendale. I guarantee to you, you won't get a ticket
10-31 13:48 <Lance Fanger> Lds church is where I always park
11-01 22:06 <Wendy Duvain> Lance good response!!
11-01 22:06 <Wendy Duvain> You're being very neutral and you're making him worked up lol
11-01 22:15 <Lance Fanger> Lol
11-01 22:16 <Lance Fanger> He has a knack for turning regular convo into somthing confrontational
11-01 22:37 <Maria la Gorda> :( I always miss the drama 
11-01 22:53 <Wendy Duvain> He does, Lance!
11-01 23:26 <Lance Fanger> i love reminding him of his hypocrisy in the friendliest way possible lol
11-01 23:33 <Wendy Duvain> I like that he got really worked up and and went on and on
11-02 07:08 <Christy King> What happened? Picture??
11-02 14:32 <Josh Lehan> I have Store!
11-02 15:24 <Justin Kominar> Last night, I was having trouble taking out a portal (low gear) that had 2xAXA on it from BadWolfBayyy... so I jarvised it and not half an hour later, Seeker came along and smashed it for me.  Tee-hee.
11-02 16:24 <Josh Lehan> Nice!
11-02 16:54 <Christy King> I guess he's good for something. And reliable ap.
11-02 16:55 <Christy King> Speaking of which, he was just here. Left a single L8 on each portal near me. Bleh!
11-02 16:55 <Justin Kominar> I'm happy to make them kill their own AXAs.  I've got plenty of Jarvis.
11-02 16:58 <Christy King> Well that makes those portals L1, and I happen to have a level 2 tadpole with me today, so guess who's gonna get a little ap and hopefully hit level 3 tonight. =) Thanks Simple! }:)
11-02 19:35 <Lance Fanger> So is the store not available to everyone? Im not finding it.
11-02 20:00 <Paula E> Hey guys, I know I haven't been any help lately.    
11-02 20:01 <Paula E> But we have an ENL agent visiting from Chicago currently. I'm en route to smash. Does anyone want to join me?
11-02 20:02 <Paula E> If not it's cool, late notice and everything
11-02 20:03 <Christy King> Lance, you stil dont have it?  =(  I got it today. Try restarting your phone.
11-02 20:04 <Christy King> Paula, I just headed out from LG or I would! Gonna meet Trung and them for pizza.
11-02 20:12 <Christy King> Ooh, but if you're around LG, please hit Legacy Church on Lark. Seekers made a big field off it since I left.
11-02 20:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If anyone sees ellue playing, I recruited him. :) He might be up by Campbell mostly. 
11-02 20:18 <Josh Lehan> Seeker is following me and letting me cash in low resonators for AP every time I place them
11-02 20:21 <Christy King> That Seeker... Such a sweetie! Hahaha
11-02 20:21 <Christy King> Liza, I'll keep an eye out and say hi if I see him! =)
11-02 20:22 <Christy King> I got TallDood to join, too. He's got a few portals around YSI so far.
11-02 20:23 <Justin Kominar> @Lance High five! :)
11-02 20:23 <Josh Lehan> Sweet
11-02 20:34 <Josh Lehan> Huge fiber optic install project near JCC. Asked a construction guy about it. Says it is for Netflix.
11-02 20:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> makes sense
11-02 20:38 <Christy King> You should recruit the construction guys, haha.
11-02 20:40 <Josh Lehan> He Ada refacfored Netflix when I walked by
11-02 20:41 <Josh Lehan> This is fun making him follow me as I collect keys
11-02 20:41 <Christy King> You have a way of getting him to waste adas and jarvises like nothing else!
11-02 20:42 <Christy King> I'm sure he thinks you're planning stuff
11-02 20:43 <Josh Lehan> He used 2 Ada already
11-02 20:44 <Josh Lehan> Dumb strategy because I still get to glyph it at high lvl
11-02 20:44 <Josh Lehan> And If he follows me then he is not elsewhere. Field away.
11-02 20:55 <Josh Lehan> At cryptic studios he filmed me and tried to document it with voice
11-02 21:04 <Lance Fanger> Thanks Justin, I was wondering if seeker was taking the night off but sounds like you guys were keeping him busy
11-02 21:06 <Christy King> Everyone else should field eeeeeeeverwhere while Josh has Simple busy! Bwahahah
11-02 21:06 <Christy King> I fielded out of the park as I was leaving, well after dark. I think I set him off. Hehe.
11-02 21:07 <Christy King> And since he'd messed with the park a bunch, I hit up the jcc area. So, he waaaaaaasn't very happy with me today. 😆
11-02 21:08 <Justin Kominar> He's already fielded over the park.
11-02 21:08 <Justin Kominar> I was contemplating going out to the other side and smashing it up.  There's a few key anchors with limited shielding.
11-02 21:11 <Christy King> Please do!
11-02 21:15 <Christy King> What are his anchor points? / iitc pic?
11-02 21:16 <Justin Kominar> Happy Hound
11-02 21:16 <Justin Kominar> Tuxedo Cat
11-02 21:16 <Justin Kominar> Kids
11-02 21:17 <Justin Kominar> Taking those out would drop most of the fields on that side of the city
11-02 21:17 <Justin Kominar> Throw in Flowers and Flame down Blossom Hill Rd and it really cleans up.
11-02 21:21 <Christy King> You know you want tooooo!  =D=D=D=D=D
11-02 21:21 <Justin Kominar> I do ...
11-02 21:21 <Justin Kominar> ah fine ...
11-02 21:21 <Christy King> Yay!!!
11-02 21:21 <Justin Kominar> Krellan looks like he needs backup anyhow  ☺
11-02 21:22 <Christy King> 💪💪💪
11-02 21:25 <Josh Lehan> He tried to say I was trespassing again when I walked on trail and near Cryptic
11-02 21:25 <Josh Lehan> All done now, left him at door of JCC whilst I go in for quick workout
11-02 21:25 <Josh Lehan> A pleasant hour warmup walk and total distraction of Seeker and over 200 low level resos used
11-02 21:26 <Josh Lehan> Who knows how many bursters that cost him
11-02 21:26 <Justin Kominar> I'm gonna clear fields now, josh
11-02 21:26 <Brian Wiebe> Nice Josh
11-02 21:27 <Brian Wiebe> Ya go team LG
11-02 21:28 <Christy King> Awesome, both of you!!!
11-02 21:39 <Justin Kominar> A easy pickings so far
11-02 21:48 <Justin Kominar> Done
11-02 21:48 <Justin Kominar> Way less blue now
11-02 21:58 <Josh Lehan> Thanks
11-02 21:59 <Josh Lehan> Spoke to security guard at JCC who thought we were together
11-02 21:59 <Josh Lehan> Told guard I did not know him and he was just a creepy guy from online game who was trying to intimidate me by following me around IRL
11-02 22:00 <Josh Lehan> Guard will be less kind to him from now on :)
11-02 22:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> lol
11-02 22:00 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
11-02 22:00 <Maria la Gorda> funny how the security thought you guys were together  :P
11-02 22:36 <Christy King> Oh, that is AWESOME!! Hahahahahahaha
11-02 22:37 <Christy King> I was surprised there was no chatter on comms earlier when I threw links from the park. Did I just miss it?
11-02 22:40 <Christy King> Btw I think he called the rangers on me. I saw 2 ranger trucks coming in as I was leaving. But of course, they know me, so they just wave at me. Heh.
11-02 22:46 <Lance Fanger> Heh nice big fields connecting to my neighborhood proving to be a good night for LG enlightened
11-02 22:48 <Josh Lehan> Excellent work
11-02 22:55 <Christy King> Yay!
11-02 23:27 <Justin Kominar> Well, Jenny's out wrecking everything I did already, but at least it's done.  +100k AP tonight from all that 
11-02 23:37 <Lance Fanger> well done
11-02 23:46 <Justin Kominar> Got to #17 in the standings tonight with all the fields too
11-02 23:48 <Christy King> Wooh!
11-02 23:55 <Josh Lehan> I think I ran Seeker entirely out of bursters so no surprise Jenny went out instead
11-02 23:56 <Justin Kominar> She was ADAing my portals
11-02 23:56 <Maria la Gorda> who fed the kids????
11-02 23:58 <Christy King> Aaaahahahaha!
11-02 23:58 <Christy King> Oh they don't care about the kids. Portals are their babies!!
11-03 00:22 <Maria la Gorda> they win parents of they year award
11-03 00:32 <Christy King> Oh yes. Definitely.
11-03 09:37 <Lance Fanger> I think their kids have to destroy portals if they want to eat
11-03 09:45 <Justin Kominar> "NO DINNER UNTIL YOU GET ON YOUR FUCKING SCOOTERS AND GO DESTROY FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH!!!"  :P
11-03 09:45 <Justin Kominar> /me : Proudly depriving Seeker's Jr's food since 2014.
11-03 09:48 <Lance Fanger> Lol
11-03 09:57 <Christy King> XDXDXDXDXD
11-03 09:58 <Christy King> They're gonna need a special kind of therapist for those kids...
11-03 09:58 <Justin Kominar> They seem like alright kids.  It irks me that he smokes around them though.
11-03 10:02 <Christy King> I saw them tromping through the park last week after mom and dad. They never looked up from their phones, though I guess that's the norm these days. *sigh*
11-03 10:02 <Justin Kominar> Pretty much ...
11-03 12:41 <Paula E> I have to get you guys some Saratoga keys so we can field back and forth 
11-03 12:56 <Justin Kominar> yes
11-03 12:56 <Justin Kominar> that would be nice
11-03 12:56 <Justin Kominar> I throw over there often
11-03 12:56 <Justin Kominar> But could always do more
11-03 13:05 <Christy King> What area of Saratoga? I have some from Hwy 9 but can't often link to there.
11-03 14:10 <Paula E> This is the area i see hit most by RES. I was thinking that now with key capsules those of us that are interested might want make the fielding larger and constant or at least have fun trying 
11-03 14:10 <Paula E> ###
11-03 15:38 <Lance Fanger> If anyone ever wants keys by LG highschool/library let me know
11-03 15:39 <Lance Fanger> I still need to get more keys at winery behind my house
11-03 20:38 <Zach Crawford> ###
11-03 20:39 <Zach Crawford> Seakey, did you field over Simple's house?
11-03 20:39 <Zach Crawford> I greened up my side of the 17 to match your side. 
11-03 20:52 <Justin Kominar> damn... that really makes me want to go out and smash again.  So many big easy targets to drop.
11-03 20:58 <Christy King> I didnt... That might have been bluefish. She's been doing a daily Piss-Off-Seeker field. =)
11-03 21:01 <Christy King> Side note: I have some keys to the Perc Ponds. If someone can find a 3rd anchor and link to a Perc pond portal like Paige Dam, and get.me a key to the other anchor, I could make a field from within Vasona just before heading out for the night. Perc Pond also closed at night. Just need one more like that on the west side, and it will be a SimpleSeekerExplosionFiesta!!
11-03 21:02 <Christy King> Smash Justin!!  Smaaaaash!!! ^_^
11-03 21:02 <Christy King> 👊👊👊
11-03 21:57 <Josh Lehan> Cool - have not seen Seeker today but did not play much either
11-04 06:44 <Christy King> Yeah, he didn't go in the park. Saw some Jenny portals on LG Blvd but those might have been from a few days ago.
11-04 07:38 <Christy King> Josh, when he was following you around the other night, he was using his car right? (Not walking / bike)
11-04 09:45 <Josh Lehan> No, he was walking 
11-04 09:45 <Josh Lehan> Gave him some good power walking exercise too, good for my warmup, I went to gym and left him jilted at the door because he is not a member so he could not follow me inside 
11-04 09:46 <Josh Lehan> Which means that he technically has no business being on JCC property *at all* not just when closed. 
11-04 09:51 <Maria la Gorda> XDXDXDXD
11-04 09:52 <unknown_105969224114245383430> They have asked him to leave after hours before. heh
11-04 09:52 <Maria la Gorda> Eating his own words!
11-04 09:52 <Maria la Gorda> 👊
11-04 09:53 <Maria la Gorda> what a troll this douchbag is
11-04 09:53 <Maria la Gorda> douchebag
11-04 09:55 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Eh, he's alright.  I get along with him, hahaha.
11-04 10:03 <Justin Kominar> He's offered to sit down over a beer with me  ☺
11-04 10:57 <Josh Lehan> I told the JCC guard at front door that I do not know that guy and he was just an online game competitor who was trying to stalk me in real life so guard knows that I do not approve of him trailing me while on JCC property 
11-04 11:32 <Wendy Duvain> Wow. Kinda creepy.
11-04 11:33 <Wendy Duvain> I have never met him but until he learns to have some manners comming People he's never met,  I'm not going to try to get to know him.
11-04 11:33 <Wendy Duvain> I never really had an opinion of him until he started comming me telling me he's gonna report me. Rude.
11-04 11:35 <Wendy Duvain> Not my job to prove anything to you if you're gonna be outright rude.
11-04 11:36 <Wendy Duvain> I've heard that some vocal members of the resistance say I'm "fake nice"  yet am "ruthless in the game."
11-04 11:36 <Wendy Duvain> Apparently I can't be "real nice" if I'm gonna be "ruthless in the game."
11-04 11:36 <Wendy Duvain> So if that's the word spreading around about me,  so be it.  I'm tired of drama.
11-04 12:00 <Maria la Gorda> smurf tears
11-04 12:05 <Christy King> Ruthless = good at what you do.
11-04 12:05 <Christy King> He's ruthless, but also very vindictive in a MO sterling kind of way (you hit one of my portals, I hit 20 of yours.)
11-04 12:07 <Christy King> But yeah, it's the rudeness that most people hate about him. And he assumes you are tresspassing and wrong and goes straight to ass mode.
11-04 12:08 <Christy King> If he was nice, a) he could ask, and find out things like "oh there's an event tonight, never mind you're ok" and b) he could teach people how to play the game without tresspassing, if they actually are, and they'd listen because he's nice.
11-04 12:09 <Christy King> Dumb phone. Vindictive in a mobster kind of way. Haha
11-04 12:13 <Christy King> My first interaction with him was my first interaction through the game with anyone besides Brian (my hubby). It was SS yelling at me on comms and then calling out my agent name out loud (in the creepiest voice ever!!!) while standing at a trailhead. And later, watching me walk to my car, not talking to me, just standing close by and taking pictures of us and my car. I was so freaked out by him I almost stopped playing entirely.
11-04 12:14 <Christy King> Thankfully Brian was with me. And apparently SS is sexist enough, he just assumed Brian was Seakay haha.
11-05 00:19 <Lance Fanger> Yikes serious dirtbag moves there
11-05 02:42 <Josh Lehan> He kept muttering about trespassing when he was following me, and shooting video of me walking around at night
11-05 02:49 <Wendy Duvain> You should have told him that you hope he makes a blockbuster movie :)
11-05 02:50 <Josh Lehan> I waved
11-05 06:11 <Maria la Gorda> that's a complete violation of ToS
11-05 07:12 <Christy King> You should say on camera that filming you us against TOS and violates your personal privacy, and you do NOT give him permission to film you. Then if he tries to show it to someone to enforce rules, HE will get in trouble.
11-05 07:13 <Christy King> I bet he was a Hall Monitor.....
11-05 08:03 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
11-05 11:00 <Josh Lehan> Yep I mentioned that taking pictures of other players against their will is against tos
11-05 11:02 <Justin Kominar> Well, wait a sec ... which of his alts was taking the pictures?  ;)
11-05 11:29 <Josh Lehan> Just him
11-05 14:26 <Christy King> Haha, ALL of them.
11-05 14:26 <Maria la Gorda> JCC was down around 1pm. Not sure if it's back up
11-05 14:29 <Maria la Gorda> never mind it's the legacy church i hit  :P
11-05 15:16 <Christy King> Oh cool! Yayyyyy Maria!!
11-05 16:40 <Christy King> Well Simpleton's in a fun mood. He followed my route through the park, made everything blue (but I attacked while he was setting up around YSI so I got to keep those) and then put a huge field over the whole park.
11-05 16:41 <Christy King> Sadly, his anchor is the dam, which I'll be driving by in an hour.
11-05 17:49 <Christy King> Right now...
11-05 17:49 <Christy King> ###
11-05 17:50 <Christy King> That dam is just waaaaaaaay too much ap to pass up!!!
11-05 18:00 <Christy King> ... Better!!
11-05 18:00 <Christy King> ###
11-05 18:01 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!
11-05 18:04 <Christy King> Who else wants some nice ap? I'm out of time and bursters...
11-05 18:04 <Christy King> ###
11-05 18:04 <Christy King> ###
11-05 18:28 <Justin Kominar> I had to hit up ace hardware on my way home. . Will see what I can do.
11-05 18:29 <Christy King> Oh, exxxxxcellent!!
11-05 18:39 <Justin Kominar> Watcher is dead
11-05 18:39 <Justin Kominar> Not worth th3 other one at this time...
11-05 19:06 <Christy King> Cool, thanks!!
11-05 19:46 <Lance Fanger> Lots of green downtown let's see how long before the fun police shows up
11-05 19:59 <Josh Lehan> I smacked Yard Lion which was holding up a big field
11-05 19:59 <Josh Lehan> Seeker story I forgot to relate, from a month ago or so
11-05 20:00 <Josh Lehan> He told me he really hates the Chameleon Power Box portal because it does not exist anymore (box was painted over) and should be removed from game
11-05 20:00 <Josh Lehan> He hates it because so tough to defend, it is at intersection and is everybody's red light farm
11-05 20:01 <Josh Lehan> Noticed it is only green portal over there in a sea of blue
11-05 20:01 <Josh Lehan> So, let's all try to build up Chameleon Power Box whenever nearby, just to needle him :)
11-05 20:15 <Christy King> I love this plan!!
11-05 20:51 <Josh Lehan> :)
11-05 20:51 <Justin Kominar> I just linked it up good
11-05 20:52 <Justin Kominar> After rebuilding my home portal that he destroyed for the 3rd time today  ;)
11-05 20:53 <Justin Kominar> Cavalry Church and Tuxedo cat really need to die too though.
11-05 22:00 <Christy King> Yes, I agree.
11-05 22:00 <Christy King> Also, Seeker needs a new hobby. Can we drop some knitting needles off at his doorstep?
11-06 09:04 <Josh Lehan> I work near those portals (Calvary and Tuxedo), probably can get today. Where is your home portal that he keeps hitting? 
11-06 09:37 <Justin Kominar> First Baptist, on Daves Ave
11-06 09:48 <Justin Kominar> https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=37.240549,-121.9786&z=17&pll=37.240773,-121.980349
11-06 11:36 <Christy King> Where is this big field over me / the park anchored? Can anyone kill it?  D:
11-06 11:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
11-06 11:38 <Justin Kominar> Sorry, I spend my days in Mountain View.  Can grab it on the way home tonight if it's still there, though.
11-06 11:51 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm walking over that way :)
11-06 11:51 <unknown_105969224114245383430> field will be down shortly
11-06 12:10 <Christy King> Yayyyyy!!!
11-06 12:31 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
11-06 12:31 <unknown_105969224114245383430> lol!
11-06 12:32 <unknown_105969224114245383430> He wasn't as excited about the field going down. 
11-06 12:33 <Maria la Gorda> nice foliage
11-06 12:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it's gorgeous out!
11-06 12:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
11-06 12:44 <Maria la Gorda> Gonna finish my lunch & then I'll go take a walk for some fresh air.
11-06 12:58 <Josh Lehan> Nice, that is what I am doing now
11-06 12:59 <Josh Lehan> If I ever roll a blue account, I really like this agent name: SimpleMinded
11-06 13:01 <Josh Lehan> Or SimpleSqueaker
11-06 13:18 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I am Green 4 Lyfe
11-06 13:19 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Always Enlightened. lol
11-06 13:35 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!
11-06 15:19 <Christy King> You guys are *AWESOME*  It's all green again!!
11-06 15:20 <Christy King> But boo to him making more fields. He should just... not. =D
11-06 16:31 <Paula E> Pls pls pls don't link thru Saratoga monte Sereno and LG I got called away. I will be back soon to finish clearing and linking thank you
11-06 16:34 <Justin Kominar> Paula - I was actually planning on dropping the Jack Rose mural on the way home tonight, but I can avoid putting any links up from it if you have something planned.
11-06 16:34 <Justin Kominar> I don't like the links he has off there right now.
11-06 16:39 <Paula E> That would be awesome if you can smash anything just please don't link
11-06 16:40 <Paula E> I know that so much to ask I'm so so sorry
11-06 16:40 <Justin Kominar> No problem.  Can do.
11-06 16:41 <Paula E> Smash away I have beenworking on this since 8 AM this morning with a sick kid going back-and-forth and I am going to get this done 
11-06 17:29 <Christy King> I made some links right around Vasona Park and LG Blvd before I saw this.
11-06 17:30 <Christy King> If any are blocking you, let me know soon cuz I can swing back into the park really quick and ADA.
11-06 18:30 <Josh Lehan> ###
11-06 18:37 <Christy King> Yup!!
11-06 21:02 <Paula E> Christie that was very nice of you to offer but I would never ask that of anybody. I already felt that I was way overstepping I just shortened it and I got interrupted needless to say
11-06 21:03 <Paula E> I guess that's why when you have an op you have more than one person
11-06 21:42 <Christy King> Not at all!! I could have ADA'ed, smashed, and redeploy ed without links. I was still in the park, so no biggie. Where were you planning to link up??
11-06 21:58 <Josh Lehan> Smurf tears WIN
11-06 21:59 <Josh Lehan> ###
11-06 21:59 <Josh Lehan> When he creepily shadowed me I made up a story and kept muttering about big field plans and never being able to get enough keys
11-06 22:00 <Josh Lehan> He fell for it and thought I had something to do with all these big green fields going up :)
11-06 22:00 <Josh Lehan> BTW I have a bunch of keys if anybody needs :)
11-06 22:11 <Christy King> XDXDXDXDXD
11-06 22:11 <Christy King> Well played, sir!! Well played!!
11-06 22:13 <Christy King> Keys to where? Vasona and around? I can take them to link up the park. Or I give keys from the edge to Zach sometimes, to link from Eriks.
11-06 22:13 <Josh Lehan> Perimeter of Lark mostly
11-06 22:14 <Josh Lehan> Thanks! Also went for walk through Vasona today.
11-06 22:17 <Christy King> I can take some. But I'd mostly be linking down towards the park probably. We should he linking north, over the jcc and Perc ponds! Like Paula was talking about - to Saratoga!!
11-06 22:18 <Christy King> Josh, I saw your handiwork today. It was awesome!! Extra thanks for bumping the ones by YSI. =)
11-06 22:47 <Josh Lehan> You are welcome :)
11-06 23:04 <Josh Lehan> ###
11-06 23:04 <Josh Lehan> Now who is trespassing? Note timestamps and location
11-06 23:06 <Wendy Duvain> Lol
11-06 23:06 <Wendy Duvain> Good job
11-06 23:06 <Josh Lehan> Know any rangers in there now? :)
11-06 23:23 <Josh Lehan> He returned home to JCC
11-07 07:13 <Christy King> Even the rangers aren't in there that late!
11-07 07:15 <Christy King> I think you could hit Paul Dubois from outside, but definitely NOT the boiler, carousel, or clock tower. Geez! What an ass. Save that pic!!
11-07 09:23 <Maria la Gorda> Last night, I babysat a mini 4 year old boy who resembled Josh. He was the most well behaved out of the 3 little munchkins
11-07 09:27 <Maria la Gorda> Made a chicken, tomato, arugula sandwich (french bread) for my hike this AM
11-07 09:27 <Maria la Gorda> he's at the park
11-07 09:28 <Maria la Gorda> If he went to Santa teresa on light rail, there are more portals to hit
11-07 09:28 <Christy King> Seeker?
11-07 09:28 <Maria la Gorda> oops wrong ho
11-07 09:28 <Christy King> Oh haha
11-07 17:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> hey christy and brian, nice job taking out alviso
11-07 18:11 <Christy King> Thanks!! It was fun. =)
11-09 09:09 <Christy King> Can anyone kill this nasty field over the park?:'(
11-09 14:43 <Josh Lehan> Anyone near Health Center Fountain? AXA AXA VRMH VRHS on it. Kill it.
11-09 15:09 <Christy King> Not near there, but could head that way around 5:30 if it's not dead.
11-09 15:10 <Christy King> Big thanks to whoever killed the field btw!! 😆
11-09 15:50 <Christy King> Dang, anyone know why there are so many sirens on 17? Big accident??
11-09 15:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
11-09 17:15 <Christy King> Thanks Liza! Our office is super close to 17 (I can see it from my window if anyone ever needs a traffic check hehe) and we must have heard at least 10 fire & ambulance roll by.
11-09 17:33 <Christy King> ###
11-09 17:33 <Christy King> They only did this one though
11-09 17:51 <Christy King> I linked, then was checking intel and looked up and there he was!!
11-09 17:51 <Christy King> But not sure if he saw me. Didn't seem to. Then I took legacy as I drove off. Hehe.
11-09 18:57 <Christy King> Check out the view from Eriks right now!!
11-09 18:57 <Christy King> ###
11-09 19:07 <Christy King> ###
11-09 19:44 <Zach Crawford> Simple is out with his friends. In lg
11-09 20:01 <Christy King> Yup. Too bad he missed cp.
11-09 20:01 <Christy King> ###
11-09 20:04 <Justin Kominar> I saw SS come out and Jarvis his portal tonight when he was that I was around smashing his stuff.
11-09 20:04 <Justin Kominar> He just didn't want me to get the AP for all those fields, so it took it himself
11-09 20:05 <Justin Kominar> Almost ran him over too... he ran right out in front of my car, the knob...
11-09 20:06 <Christy King> You shouldn't have stopped...
11-09 20:06 <Christy King> The car, I mean
11-09 20:07 <Justin Kominar> Well, the clean-up is a bitch ...
11-09 20:08 <Justin Kominar> It was for the best  :P
11-09 20:14 <Christy King> I guesssssss. ;)
11-09 20:32 <Christy King> Apparently the Seeker family moved on to Campbell, so who wants to have some fun with the JCC?
11-09 21:12 <Justin Kominar> I do appreciate how they've started including Saratoga in their travels just to ensure they have the keys they need to field over me.
11-09 21:46 <Christy King> Same here. They really go out of their way for us. Very thoughtful.
11-10 17:11 <Maria la Gorda> YEAHHHHHH
11-10 17:17 <Christy King> 👊👊👊 Goooooooo Maria!!!
11-10 17:18 <Maria la Gorda> ###
11-10 17:26 <Josh Lehan> Congrats on 11
11-10 17:26 <Josh Lehan> Seeker is going to love what I did to YSI area today
11-10 17:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hey guys.  I know Milpitas maybe far for some of you but I want to put it out there we will be having a rolling build tomorrow night and you are all welcome to join.  It will start at 8:30
11-10 17:36 <Josh Lehan> Nice, unfortunately I am in SF on most Wednesday nights
11-10 17:36 <Maria la Gorda> Thanks Josh Lehan!
11-10 17:36 <Christy King> Josh, it looks *Awesome*!
11-10 17:37 <Christy King> Palko, can't do Wednesday, sorry. =(
11-10 17:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's ok I was just letting you guys know
11-10 18:24 <Christy King> ###
11-10 18:24 <Christy King> Think he'll mind?  O:)
11-10 18:29 <Maria la Gorda> XDXDXD
11-10 18:44 <Christy King> InKleinNation doesn't seem to give a Shiiiit about tresspassing. Good to know.
11-10 18:44 <Christy King> ###
11-10 18:45 <Christy King> ###
11-10 18:45 <Maria la Gorda> is SimpleSeeker yelling at him?
11-10 18:45 <Christy King> ###
11-10 18:45 <Christy King> No, I let him know rangers are patrolling. But not yelling, just an FYI, because they were citing people earlier.
11-10 18:46 <Christy King> ....and then I remade the field over Seeker's house. XD
11-10 18:46 <Christy King> View from the dam.
11-10 18:46 <Christy King> ###
11-10 18:47 <Christy King> That's Eriks in the starburst. Mostly Zach's doing.

11-10 18:50 <Maria la Gorda> Who wants to go see Spectre with me tonight at 10:25pm at CineArts in Santana Row? It's only $6.25/ticket
http://www.cinemark.com/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=1679
11-10 18:51 <Maria la Gorda> I have an HOA meeting tonight, which I'm late for; reason I can't go to the earlier show
11-10 18:55 <Josh Lehan> Nice - I saw the park attack also, and was wondering WTF
11-10 19:22 <Brian Wiebe> Nice Christy
11-10 19:22 <Christy King> Yeah, InKleinNation seems to ride his bike north in the morning and south after work, pinging portals on his way. But not usually blatant after-dark tresspassing.
11-10 19:23 <Christy King> I find it ironic that he trespassed to take down the field over Seeker's house.
11-10 19:41 <Josh Lehan> Wow, lots of entertaining taunting on cross faction COMM around here tonight
11-10 19:59 <Christy King> Screenshots??
11-10 20:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We are in Santa Cruz,  will be back for more of his axas

11-10 20:54 <Christy King> Ohhhh huh my god.
11-10 20:55 <Christy King> How about that it took the 4 of his family all day to take down what I did in the park one afternoon... while I was level *6*. XD
11-10 20:55 <Christy King> He is so completely full of himself.
11-10 20:55 <Josh Lehan> Yep
11-10 20:57 <Christy King> Wtf why doesn't it ping me when something is being attacked?? All resos and mods on it were mine...
11-10 20:57 <Christy King> ###
11-10 20:58:31 *** Christy King added user 'Matt Corley' to conversation
11-10 20:59 <Christy King> Adding Technophile from Santa Cruz. He wants to help SimpleMinded get the beat down he deserves. =)
11-10 21:01 <Maria la Gorda> Welcome Matt  ☺
11-10 21:01 <Matt Corley> woop woop. I'm in Scotts Valley, so not too far for some smashing ^_^
11-10 21:02 <Matt Corley> like 20 min away
11-10 21:02 <Matt Corley> I hit their stuff saturday night, and they sent simpleenough down to Scotts Valley the next day
11-10 21:03 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
11-10 21:03 <Matt Corley> he/she didn't do much ^_^;;
11-10 21:03 <Maria la Gorda> smurf tears
11-10 21:03 <Matt Corley> newb
11-10 21:03 <Matt Corley> Yeah really
11-10 21:03 <Matt Corley> OK we're building Santa Cruz. bbl
11-10 22:12 <Christy King> Matt is also really good at catching and documenting cheaters, so he should have LOADS of fun with SimpleSeeker and crew. =D
11-10 23:40 <Matt Corley> ah, I'll have to see if anything interesting shows up then
11-10 23:41 <Matt Corley> on a related note, I've circled several res and this is the first time I've had this kind of response. weird...:|
11-10 23:41 <Matt Corley> ###
11-10 23:43 <unknown_105969224114245383430> There's a few Res that like to keep a mostly Res FL. 
11-10 23:52 <Wendy Duvain> Are you guys able to spot simple enough?
11-10 23:52 <Wendy Duvain> They deployed on us
11-10 23:52 <Wendy Duvain> And nobody else seems to be playing ingress
11-10 23:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Does he work by Walgreens?
11-10 23:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Because I was being deploy defended on and no one is in this parking lot
11-10 23:55 <Justin Kominar> I run into seeker all the time... -enough, has been tougher to spot.
11-10 23:55 <Justin Kominar> Unless he's drifting, you can't actually get that portal from inside the Walgreens.
11-10 23:55 <unknown_105969224114245383430> No one is here
11-10 23:55 <Justin Kominar> You need to be out in the parking lot.
11-10 23:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ok whatever he's not showing up on iitc but I swear resos were appearing
11-11 00:01 <Christy King> Meanwhile, Simple added Josh (Krellan) to his circles out of the blue. He is just a tweaker.
11-11 00:03 <Justin Kominar> He's punchy tonight because I joking accused him of having alts when he started nagging me in com  ;)
11-11 06:54 <Christy King> He's probably touchy on the subject because he really does. He revealed a green alt one night mid-tantrum! ^_^;;
11-11 07:50 <Wendy Duvain> Yup :)
11-11 09:45 <Josh Lehan> Seeker is ####### btw - OK to repost all my screenshots - I take another whenever he posts something in COMM 
11-11 09:48 <Justin Kominar> Just be careful .. I believe it's just as TOS-violating to be outing his real-life personal details as it is for him to be filming you, etc.
11-11 09:48 <Justin Kominar> Until you meet him and know him in real life, he's just Seeker.  (or "Simple" if you want to get his goat  ;)
11-11 09:49 <Maria la Gorda> I think you can't out him in all COMM
11-11 09:51 <Maria la Gorda> & he does say that he's SimpleSeeker in one of his G+ post
11-11 10:03 <Wendy Duvain> Yes but you shouldn't be using real names in comms even if they reveal elsewhere
11-11 10:04 <Wendy Duvain> Just like just because I know your real name bc you're my friend I still shouldn't be using names in comms unless I have your explicit directions
11-11 10:08 <Justin Kominar> ^ agreed.  Gotta take the high road, especially when dealing with people like Seeker.  It's easier to point fingers when you know you're squeaky clean  ;)
11-11 10:09 <Maria la Gorda> O:)O:)O:)O:)O:)
11-11 11:30 <Justin Kominar> If anyone (Liza?) can pop the Goodwill Donation portal on Lark, there's a potentially very large field there for Seeker to finish soon.
11-11 11:31 <Justin Kominar> The links from my home portal are blocking at the moment, but it's easy for him to clear that and make quite a large field by closing that up.
11-11 12:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I took Goodwill Donation out ☺
11-11 12:04 <unknown_105969224114245383430> And yeah - I block all his RL info when talking about SimpleSeeker.  It's why I cover up his name in screenshots.  Just general courtesy.  
11-11 13:02 <Justin Kominar> Thanks Liza!
11-11 13:02 <Justin Kominar> I'd have done it on my way home from work today, but I prefer not giving him the option of making it at all  ☺
11-11 16:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Simpleenough seems to use a lot of AXA shields
11-11 16:25 <Justin Kominar> For a new player ... yes ... I've noticed that too
11-11 16:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> After I'm done with taking over Milpitas I wanna start playing in Los Gatos
11-11 16:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> He won't be using any more AXA shields after that
11-11 16:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm following him on my scanner I am trying to see if he drops gear
11-11 16:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Do you ever do that?
11-11 16:27 <Justin Kominar> I generally just Jarvis their AXA'd portals, and they kill them for me  ☺
11-11 16:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We have caught a few smurfs dropping gear to them selves
11-11 16:28 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Level 6 and under with an AXA on it is fairly easy to kill hit then fast and those shields go to waste
11-11 16:29 <Justin Kominar> I keep my eye out, but I'm not on a specific witch hunt, so it's just random chance for me at this point to catch him ... but his name and playing patterns to raise a bit of suspicion.
11-11 16:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yeah it does
11-11 16:30 <Justin Kominar> But honestly, I don't think Seeker's dumb enough to do that.  I strongly suspect they're trolling us, and just feeding an actual real player just to mess with us.
11-11 16:31 <unknown_105969224114245383430> what is weird is the guy made a google profile and introduced themselves saying ' does anyone play in los gatos ' but has a simple name
11-11 16:31 <unknown_105969224114245383430> that is not normal
11-11 16:32 <unknown_105969224114245383430> https://plus.google.com/u/0/#####
11-11 16:34 <Justin Kominar> https://www.linkedin.com/in/#### ?
11-11 16:34 <Justin Kominar> Doubt it ... what's an SVP doing mucking around in Ingress?  :P
11-11 16:34 <Christy King> Simple has actually tones it DOWN lately on the axas from what I've seen. He wasted a ton on the park one day... and then Justin and others took 'em out and the next round was common shields. My guess is that he uses his kids a bit as mules, with mufgs growing axas, adas, and jarvises aplenty. (All the more funny he tried to claim he single-handedly owns LG, since he drags his kids around to help a lot)
11-11 16:35 <Justin Kominar> http://www.#######
11-11 16:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i have a few hundred but I dont lay them down anywhere I just keep making more o_O
11-11 16:35 <Justin Kominar> hmm... he's got an amateur photography hobby... so maybe that's him after all
11-11 16:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I believe it is a real guy but it is odd he would introduce himself asking if people play in los gatos
11-11 16:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> with the name simple
11-11 16:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> in the ingress community
11-11 16:36 <Christy King> Oh good to know, they just met SimpleEnough online. Folks have been wondering if they're connected. I didn't think so, but that confirms it.
11-11 16:36 <Justin Kominar> Yeah... he's legit.  Just found this on his FB page:
11-11 16:37 <Justin Kominar> ###
11-11 16:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> so how random is that 
11-11 16:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> he puts simple in his name
11-11 16:37 <unknown_105969224114245383430> its a setup I tell you!
11-11 16:37 <Christy King> They're all pretty "simple" on that team! ;)
11-11 16:37 <Christy King> Oh speak of the }:)
11-11 16:38 <Christy King> JennyAppleseed is in the park
11-11 16:38 <Justin Kominar> Well, according to FB, he lives in Lexington Hills
11-11 16:38 <Justin Kominar> So LG makes sense
11-11 16:38 <Christy King> ...and took out Hak one Gardens in Saratoga an hour ago. That's further than I usually see her. Maybe planning something?
11-11 16:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> he just put 6 axa shields around the LG lodge
11-11 16:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> hit it asap
11-11 16:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> o-O
11-11 16:38 <Christy King> Hakone Gardens
11-11 16:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> that will teach this guy
11-11 16:40 <Christy King> Yeah, she went past a bunch of green to hot Circle Lot.
11-11 16:40 <Justin Kominar> I'm about ready to leave work.  I'll head through Saratoga on the way back in and mess stuff up there.
11-11 16:40 <Christy King> To hit circle lot
11-11 16:40 <Christy King> Yay!
11-11 16:40 <Christy King> You know Hakone Gardens?
11-11 16:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> 6 axa shields all the portals are l5
11-11 16:41 <Justin Kominar> hmm.. acutally, they're IN the gardens, not the outer portal
11-11 16:41 <Justin Kominar> So maybe not.
11-11 16:42 <Justin Kominar> Yeah - I've been there.  have some keys stored up, actually.
11-11 16:42 <Christy King> One is on the road
11-11 16:42 <Justin Kominar> I think Monte Sereno post office is next best option then.
11-11 16:42 <Christy King> She's at Vasona now. Maybe make a blocker?
11-11 16:42 <Christy King> I could, too, if there's a lane clear. Have some keys to Saratoga / Hwy 9
11-11 16:43 <Christy King> I'm at YSI Vasona
11-11 16:43 <Justin Kominar> I'll take out the post office in about an hour.
11-11 16:43 <Christy King> K.
11-11 16:45 <Christy King> Oh god I see what you mean. I got pinged for the Hakone one on the road, but she made a field from inside. Ugh.
11-11 16:45 <Justin Kominar> Yeah... you'd likely have to go into the gardens themselves to pop it.
11-11 16:45 <Christy King> I want to make a field.from inside Vasona at closing time. (Aka SS tantrum time). But to where??
11-11 16:45 <Justin Kominar> So not gonna bother.
11-11 16:46 <Christy King> Ughhh
11-11 16:46 <Justin Kominar> Good thing is that the post office on 9 isn't a hard kill.
11-11 16:46 <Christy King> Yay!!!
11-11 16:46 <Christy King> I have a key to it... maybe we make our own field?
11-11 16:47 <Justin Kominar> I don't have many keys to inside the park these days.  Just yard lions and the oak meadow signs on the perimeter ... which are all easy for him to kill too.
11-11 16:47 <Justin Kominar> Can try though.
11-11 16:48 <Christy King> Oh, just meet me for lunch or after work one of these days. I will hook you up!!
11-11 16:48 <Christy King> I can also link from the park, out.
11-11 16:48 <Justin Kominar> k - I'm packing up and hitting the road.  next stop, monte sereno post office.
11-11 16:49 <Christy King> Gooooo, Justin!!
11-11 16:49 <Christy King> 💪💪💪
11-11 16:51 <Christy King> In other news, bluefish asked if she can come back to this HO:
11-11 16:52 <Christy King> "May I be added back into the lg hangout?  I left cause I didn't trust myself to not be very negative on it due to other hangout crap and I liked that hangout a lot.  But understand if you say no and will still be your ingress buddy"
11-11 16:54 <Christy King> Does anybody mind? If there are objections I won't add her, but she has been greening LG and fielding over the jcc a ton, so I'm all for more coordinated attacks.
11-11 16:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I don't mind, I've drank beer with her when she was still on the blue team. lol
11-11 17:04 <Maria la Gorda> I don't have any objections
11-11 17:06 <Maria la Gorda> i could use margaritas or something
11-11 17:06 <Justin Kominar> I've met her once. . Fine with me.
11-11 17:24 <Maria la Gorda> I have 60 X8. I need gear... & I'm too exhausted to go to DTLA or Milpitas. So I hope to see more local L8 agents at the Cambpell farm tonight so that we can have an L8 farm
11-11 17:34 <Justin Kominar> Post office is down
11-11 17:35 <Lance Fanger> Nice
11-11 17:37 <Lance Fanger> Simpleenough just told me he lived near safeway in los gatos
11-11 17:37 <Lance Fanger> Lives
11-11 17:39 <Justin Kominar> In person?
11-11 17:40 <Lance Fanger> No on com he flipped safeway mural with an ADA and told me to get used to it being blue cuase he lives right there
11-11 17:45 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Or he can get used to walking to Safeway from his house a lot
11-11 17:50 <Josh Lehan> I fought in SF all day and am out of cubes and bursters 
11-11 17:50 <Justin Kominar> There is no house within range of that portal. . He must have to walk at least a little to get there.
11-11 17:50 <Josh Lehan> Good to take an offensive role for once, felt good 
11-11 18:03 <Zach Crawford> ###
11-11 18:03 <Zach Crawford> There we go
11-11 18:04 <Zach Crawford> I met simpleseeker in person last night at Erik's Deli. He was a nice guy when I was talking with him. 
11-11 18:22 <Zach Crawford> He admitted that he gets a little intense while playing. And he mentioned that he is anal about trespassing, which I kinda figured out already. 
11-11 18:23 <Zach Crawford> He's a veteran and said that he had today off so I thought that LG BLVD was going to be blue everywhere but he must have gone somewhere else. 
11-11 18:24 <Christy King> Maybe he did Vets Day stuff. Jenny rolled into the park but not til late.
11-11 18:25 <Zach Crawford> I told him how much I appreciate how much work he makes for me and I think that may have gotten to him because he packed up and left the Erik's portal alone
11-11 18:26 <Christy King> Next time someone talks to Seeker in person, maybe bring up the way he assumes tresspassing but it isn't always, and nicer ways to go about saying something / actually asking.
11-11 18:26 <Christy King> Huh.
11-11 18:26 <Zach Crawford> He asked if I was chat blocking him or something to that effect but I told him to look at the two multihacks on the portal and see that I'm not even recharging it. 
11-11 18:28 <Zach Crawford> Oh and I found out that he definitely does not like being called Simple. I rolled up and asked is he was "Simple" and he corrected me, " It's SimpleSeeker". I didn't mean to offend him but you could tell he was annoyed. 
11-11 18:28 <Christy King> Btw Justin / Lance, there are apartments right behind Safeway, but probably not in range. Houses across N Santa Cruz Ave too, behind the businesses... but again, probably out of range. And even if so, he will have to waste a looooooooove of adas, and bursters once he runs out. Heh. Should be fun!!
11-11 18:29 <Christy King> He should have picked a better name lol.
11-11 20:37 <Justin Kominar> -5 seeker axas in oak meadow now, btw.  Amazing what you can reach from the sidewalk ;-)
11-11 20:46 <Josh Lehan> Simple is nice enough in person when he is not being a jerk 
11-11 20:52 <Christy King> Haha
11-11 21:03 <Josh Lehan> He said he does not talk to me anymore but then he keeps talking to me 
11-12 03:33 <Maria la Gorda> In case the field goes down before you go out & see it. Paula & I built it after the DTC farm.
11-12 03:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Nice job!
11-12 04:07 <Paula E> I just followed her superb direction. Thanks for taking the time with me  tonight. I enjoyed your company
11-12 08:13 <Christy King> Oh that is beauuuuutiful!! Did it make cp? Still up??
11-12 09:32 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Josh & Christy! It was a lot of fun smashing & fielding with Paula. Last we knew, it made one CP  ☺ I don't think the whole field made CP  :(
11-12 09:36 <Justin Kominar> Oh wow ... very nice job on that field!
11-12 09:46 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Justin  ☺
11-12 11:08 <Josh Lehan> Wow nice field
11-12 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> Thank you Josh!
11-12 11:23 <Josh Lehan> Just spent an hour in park where my home portal is, it was quite a battle, I am tapped
11-12 11:31 <Justin Kominar> In "a" park, or with your car in "park"?  ☺
11-12 11:33 <Josh Lehan> In CV Community Center park in Castro Valley
11-12 11:38 <Josh Lehan> I live close and try to keep it green and a local microfarm, smurfs from all around come to attack, I try to defend
11-12 11:38 <Josh Lehan> In some ways it feels as futile as Seeker trying to keep "his" Vasona blue
11-12 11:45 <Justin Kominar> Wow - you've got quite a commute, Josh
11-12 11:45 <Justin Kominar> I have a bunch of keys to the Chabot observatories... you should clear a path on your way into work one day and we'll mega field  :P
11-12 11:45 <Josh Lehan> If ever up here, would love to see you, 19 portals nicely close together, other 2 are short walk
11-12 11:46 <Josh Lehan> Cool idea - smurf lair is northwest of me, though, be some work to fight through there
11-12 15:32 <Christy King> Hmm, looks like Simple got a little grumpy that I took out his axas on my lunch break.
11-12 15:32 <Christy King> ###
11-12 15:38 <Justin Kominar> I popped 5 of his axas on those same portals last night.
11-12 15:46 <Christy King> Morgan Stanley? That's where I popped them today
11-12 15:46 <Justin Kominar> Oh, sorry.. i though it was YSI and the other Oak Meadow park ones.
11-12 15:46 <Christy King> Level 5 portal with a tiny field and 2 axas. Lol.
11-12 15:46 <Justin Kominar> I didn't look at the screenshot close enough.
11-12 15:46 <Christy King> Nope, those are what he is currently taking his vengeance on.
11-12 15:47 <Christy King> Speaking of which, he's not at home if anyone wants to hit jcc.
11-12 15:47 <Christy King> Also, I'm adding bluefish since no one minded. =)
11-12 15:47:52 *** Christy King added user 'fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck' to conversation
11-12 15:48 <Christy King> (Google hasn't let her change her name back)
11-12 15:48 <Justin Kominar> Good to have you back, blue
11-12 16:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hi kids
11-12 16:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How goes
11-12 16:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I messed up bad on that Google name change thing. Bear with me on that,  I'm feeling the repercussions from it daily cause I can't send anyone email now
11-12 16:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dumb dumb dumb
11-12 16:06 <Christy King> It goes well! Did you catch all the Seeker rants the other day? I finally responded, on all comm. Couldn't help it.
11-12 16:06 <Christy King> ###
11-12 16:06 <Christy King> ###
11-12 16:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No but I'm about to go to court for his bs, any screenshots would help
11-12 16:07 <Christy King> Scroll up.
11-12 16:07 <Justin Kominar> Court.  Seriously?
11-12 16:07 <Justin Kominar> :(
11-12 16:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Okay so I don't mean to bring drama here but need to inform
11-12 16:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Over the summer ###### tried to get a restraining order against me
11-12 16:08 <Christy King> Josh (Krellan) posted a bunch maybe 2 nights ago. Also about how Simple followed him around.
11-12 16:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Court sent us to mediation and the mediator got him to do a stipulated agreement instead, she pointed out a judge wasn't likely to grant a restraining order when the harassment has been 2 sided and reluctantly he agreed
11-12 16:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Stipulation number 4 says if we are in the same place, we are to act as if strangers and both part ways
11-12 16:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And these days he just comes right to whatever portal I'm at, will just stand there. A few weeks ago he followed me around my own neighborhood til like 4am, me on my bike and him in a car
11-12 16:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He's escalating and the degree to which he has done so has begun to frighten me
11-12 16:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So yes, going back to court.  Will be asking for a full restraining order against him and for a judge to sanction him
11-12 16:14 <Justin Kominar> Sorry to hear that.  It's sucky it's gotten so out of hand.
11-12 16:14 <Justin Kominar> It's just a dumb game.
11-12 16:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Telling you guys this means I trust you all to some degree, and trust is hard for me lately. I won't go on and on about it but please just keep the info among us
11-12 16:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah its stupidseeker
11-12 16:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And it's only been getting worse.
11-12 16:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So yeah, I just wanna play and not get bullshit when I do. Don't like me? Fine, don't play with me and don't talk to me, but don't go out of your way to freakin scare me or bother me too, that's my take
11-12 16:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry to start off my return to this awesome hangout with this, but I think yall needed to know what my deal with him is right now
11-12 16:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Now on to better things, marialagorda that was one fine set of fields you threw last night!
11-12 16:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Who is liza? Just seeing who all is on here,  not sure your agent name
11-12 16:21 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i still wanna bake cookies and hang out with everyone sometime
11-12 16:21 <unknown_105969224114245383430> (snowpupgirl)
11-12 16:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Mmmmm cookies!
11-12 16:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh!!!
11-12 16:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hi!
11-12 16:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Good to see you!
11-12 16:22 <unknown_105969224114245383430> :)
11-12 16:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You didn't recognize me with the mustache, right?
11-12 16:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bwahaha
11-12 16:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You're so funny girl
11-12 16:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm really glad you're on this hangout!
11-12 16:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I still work in Los Gatos, just not at work much lately. :)
11-12 16:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Did you move to Milpitas or something?
11-12 16:32 <Christy King> I am up for a cookie party!!
11-12 16:33 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I did move to Milpitas. Bigger place. :)
11-12 16:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We could have a baking party and make cookies with glyph icing on each

11-12 16:45 <Justin Kominar> 🕓
11-12 16:45 <Justin Kominar> ^ cookie o'clock
11-12 16:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
11-12 16:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was thinking time cookie!
11-12 16:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh or
11-12 16:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cookie time
11-12 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's so cold today, I don't remember it getting this cold here last time I lived here
11-12 16:53 <Josh Lehan> fuckoffadric: how long until you can change your name back to something more family-friendly? 
11-12 16:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol you can call me Barbara or bluefish. Apparently Google only let's you change it 3x every 3 months
11-12 16:54 <Josh Lehan> I spent all my bursters fighting to retake my couch portal at home and the nearby park, it was quite a battle this morning, so I am tapped 
11-12 16:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I had changed it to pezcado azul a few weeks prior
11-12 16:54 <Josh Lehan> OK so it is a bit of a wait then... Sucks. But it is Google so what can you do? I have had portals approved in less time :) 
11-12 16:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So not exactly sure
11-12 16:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I try every other day to change it back since I don't know when the 3 months is up
11-12 16:58 <Josh Lehan> Cool - Seeker is retaking the park 
11-12 17:07 <Christy King> @Justin Why what do you know? It's Cookie O'clock right now?! =D
11-12 17:09 <Christy King> @Josh yeah, it's pretty much all blue. I can undo a little before I head out.
11-12 17:12 <Josh Lehan> Will have to fix it when better equipped 
11-12 19:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I slept til damn near 3 today
11-12 19:37 <Maria la Gorda> That's a good sleep
11-12 19:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Indeed, although it means I'm a little screwed for keeping a normal schedule
11-12 19:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
11-12 19:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Mayne after work I'll do some trespassgressing
11-12 19:39 <Maria la Gorda> I've been getting so little sleep in the past weeks. I look like death. Death has become me. I didn't need a halloween costume
11-12 19:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hehe
11-12 19:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've not gotten enough sleep lately,  new schedule at has me on evening shift for a little while
11-12 19:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Trying to find the perfect balance
11-12 19:41 <Maria la Gorda> I'm just stressed out with job search & lack of money
11-12 19:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maria I totally understand
11-12 19:42 <Maria la Gorda> so my subconcience is reminding me that I have bills to pay
11-12 19:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ingress is actually quite awesome if you're not working and broke
11-12 19:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Free entertainment
11-12 19:43 <Maria la Gorda> yeah, but the more I ingress, the more stressed out I get. Because instead of looking for a job, I'm ingressing. I've stop playing so that I can concentrate on my job search
11-12 19:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I hear that too
11-12 19:45 <Maria la Gorda> I try to ingress at night & leave the daytime for job hunt
11-12 19:45 <Maria la Gorda> but now with safety issues & the cold, I'd rather ingress in the daytime
11-12 19:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-12 19:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If you're awake tonight like past 130 and wanted an ingress buddy I'm available
11-12 19:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This does not help your job search I know!
11-12 19:47 <Maria la Gorda> I'll let you know
11-12 19:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cool
11-12 19:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's also my Friday woo!
11-12 19:48 <Maria la Gorda> woot!!
11-12 21:37 <Zach Crawford> I snuck out to get this
11-12 21:37 <Zach Crawford> ###

11-12 22:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I also hit 12 (again) recently but was kinda too bummed about stupid crap to tell anyone
11-12 22:27 <Justin Kominar> Well also well done then!@

11-12 23:31 <Christy King> ###
11-13 00:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Congrats to you all! :)
11-13 00:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nice job christy!
11-13 00:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can I quit my job now
11-13 00:42 <Maria la Gorda> Congrats Bluefish & Zach on leveling up  ☺
11-13 00:42 <Maria la Gorda> I wish Ingress paid me to play  ☺
11-13 01:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Man this week kinda was hard and I didn't get nearly enough ingress time
11-13 01:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And it's cold
11-13 01:40 <Maria la Gorda> I hearyou, the cold is getting me down
11-13 01:40 <Maria la Gorda> to not ingress when it's cold
11-13 01:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah and it's harder without a car
11-13 01:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Car you can at least turn the heat on
11-13 01:43 <Maria la Gorda> yes
11-13 01:43 <Maria la Gorda> I think we're in a polar vortex
11-13 01:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe mercury is in a polar retrograde
11-13 01:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm having crazy thoughts of just staying in seattle and not coming back heh
11-13 01:45 <Maria la Gorda> is it warmer there?
11-13 01:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not particularly no
11-13 01:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just miss having people I know really well and who know me very well nearby
11-13 01:47 <Maria la Gorda> I hear you. Having a support group is important
11-13 01:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah, more than I realized
11-13 02:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> More ingress tomorrow, time to be warm
11-13 02:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Night all
11-13 07:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So who threw these fields
11-13 07:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Pretty impressive
11-13 07:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn, hawaii
11-13 07:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was that anyone local?
11-13 07:37 <Maria la Gorda> I dunno but it's sure is pretty  ☺
11-13 07:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It sure is!
11-13 07:38 <Maria la Gorda> nice to wake up to it
11-13 07:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
11-13 07:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Time to check in for my flight!  Woo,  today is a whole new day folks!
11-13 07:43 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ask ###### if he can throw a field to hawaii 
11-13 07:43 <Maria la Gorda> Have some good fun Blue!
11-13 07:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm not going to let this one suck
11-13 07:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too much suck lately not enough yay
11-13 07:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
11-13 07:47 <unknown_105969224114245383430> #hatethatguy
11-13 07:48 <Zach Crawford> What is he referring to? "If you keep coming"
11-13 07:49 <unknown_105969224114245383430> coms
11-13 07:49 <unknown_105969224114245383430> coms meaning ingress comms
11-13 07:49 <unknown_105969224114245383430> comming* in 
11-13 07:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I would not respond,  he's a fucking psycho fuck nuts
11-13 07:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry to cuss so bad
11-13 07:52 <Zach Crawford> Oh, I thought it was a typo. Why would he not want you to use a basic function of the game? And how would he even accomplish that, I can't believe that he could have the ability to stop every blue player from coming to Los Gatos.  
11-13 07:53 <unknown_105969224114245383430> im at a split
11-13 07:53 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I really  rerally need to fuck off santa clara
11-13 07:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> but I hate simple
11-13 07:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> santa clarta is a bit more of a threat
11-13 07:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh I think he has the capacity to be violent I really do, please be careful
11-13 07:55 <unknown_105969224114245383430> who in here is available for los gatos farms and what times and days are you all free
11-13 07:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This is way more than a game for him
11-13 07:55 <unknown_105969224114245383430> bluefish what days and times are you free
11-13 07:55 <unknown_105969224114245383430> we need to make more farms in this area
11-13 07:55 <Zach Crawford> He is ex-military but I don't think he would go so fast as to be violent, he has two kids and a wife to think of. 
11-13 07:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> no he is not violent he is just retarded
11-13 07:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I will be able to answer that better after I go into work today wherein I'm discussing my schedule with my boss
11-13 07:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> bluefish after this weekend
11-13 07:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i really need to focus on santa clara
11-13 07:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No I really do think he could be violent
11-13 07:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> but I wanna help lg at the same time
11-13 07:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> hes not violent at all
11-13 07:56 <Maria la Gorda> Well I can tell you that in throwing the SJ field for my onyx illuminator badge, Rota333 & GirlyFlower threw a hostile tactic role play. I completely thought that one of our agents would be attacked
11-13 07:57 <Maria la Gorda> while I was throwing the field
11-13 07:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He forgets about things like his family every time he leaves work for several hours to ingress
11-13 07:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> the guy is just a nerd
11-13 07:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i mean he is a bubble boy
11-13 07:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That is risky thought josh
11-13 07:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It really is
11-13 07:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> no offense to his family i am sure they aremormon which is cool
11-13 07:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> dude
11-13 07:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i wanna distroy lg
11-13 07:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Do what you want of course but please be careful
11-13 07:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> care at taking portals?
11-13 07:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> careful?
11-13 07:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> what I really want to do is pump you guys up
11-13 07:59 <Zach Crawford> I met Simple and talked with him for a good 15 minutes, he knows that he takes the game seriously and he also knows that it is just a game. 
11-13 07:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ive been playing this game for years now
11-13 07:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> zach cool, well he also takes people to court and calls the cops on them
11-13 07:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Careful meaning please make sure you are situationally aware of your surroundings when ingress playing
11-13 08:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> all I wanna do is turn the place green
11-13 08:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> so if his version of ' taking it seriously ' is calling the 5 - 0 on inicent  people then whatever
11-13 08:01 <Zach Crawford> I agree that he can be a jerk, it's not like he hasn't messaged me in comms and said that he would report me. 
11-13 08:01 <Zach Crawford> For trespassing
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> zach , a jerk?
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> listen
11-13 08:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I hear you
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> there are socially awkward people who people
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> introverts 
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> even
11-13 08:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> there are smack talkers
11-13 08:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I also know he is escalating
11-13 08:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> but for this guy to call the police over portals?
11-13 08:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> he has lost it
11-13 08:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> maybe for that 15 minutes he was normal
11-13 08:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Followed me personally around in a car one night
11-13 08:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> but he is not
11-13 08:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah he has lost it
11-13 08:02 <Zach Crawford> But I can't believe that someone that is aware that he can call the police on someone playing the game and would be violent which would definitely be something the police would be involved in. 
11-13 08:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> bluefish I promise u
11-13 08:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like, I don't think he was like this when I first met him
11-13 08:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> we will take lg not now not tomorrow but we will
11-13 08:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> and when we do he will put his scanner down
11-13 08:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh how bout right now
11-13 08:03 <Zach Crawford> I've been followed on a number of occasions and not just by simple
11-13 08:03 <Zach Crawford> It happens. 
11-13 08:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Smash lg for an hour or two then I'll go to work
11-13 08:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Zach did you have court orders with any of those people though that should have prevented that
11-13 08:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause I sure do and that's part of it
11-13 08:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> A court order he sought out
11-13 08:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This is way more than a game for him
11-13 08:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's all
11-13 08:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I remember a time when I just played the game and never used comms
11-13 08:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That might be a good thing to return to
11-13 08:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> For me
11-13 08:22 <Maria la Gorda> I used COMM right away when I started because I needed help playing the game, specially getting gear
11-13 08:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I just hacked portals and was wide eyed about like ooh there's a portal up there what is it!
11-13 08:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Didn't fire a single burster til level 6
11-13 08:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Didn't know how
11-13 08:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> when are you going to change your name
11-13 08:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> i dont wanna wait 3 months
11-13 08:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> dude ur gay lol
11-13 08:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Soon as Google lets me
11-13 08:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dude,  homophobic speech kinda went out in the 90s
11-13 08:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just sayin
11-13 08:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I know you don't mean anything by it
11-13 08:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh I'm sorry the name thing upsets you, bear with me, I can't send email til I can change it, so it's definitely pretty important to me too to get it changed back
11-13 08:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Google should pop up a thing you have to click ok on when you make that last name change that will then prevent you from changing it for 3 months
11-13 08:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause had I known that, wouldn't have changed it
11-13 08:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But back to the game talk
11-13 08:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think I dropped my phone one too many times
11-13 08:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone else having problems with ingress and rendering that baf?
11-13 08:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ingress has crashed a number of times for me this morning
11-13 08:40 <Maria la Gorda> ever since the app upgraded to 1.85.1, it crashed daily for me. At 1.86.0, it has crashed multiple time during the day
11-13 08:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ugh that sucks
11-13 08:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sweet jaesus it's cold
11-13 08:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> California is not supposed to get this cold!
11-13 08:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've turned into a weather wimp
11-13 09:01 <Christy King> It's been going a little slow for me today, too
11-13 09:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok maybe not just me then
11-13 09:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I did drop my phone a few times recently
11-13 09:02 <Maria la Gorda> frozen fingers?
11-13 09:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well
11-13 09:02 <Maria la Gorda> Do you have the glove
11-13 09:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I outsmarted myself
11-13 09:02 <Maria la Gorda> that you can touch the screen with?
11-13 09:02 <Maria la Gorda> I need to get those gloves
11-13 09:02 <Maria la Gorda> My fingers are freezing in the cold
11-13 09:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The battery in my phone stopped holding charge so I ordered a new one online and got the higher capacity one
11-13 09:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Which I didn't realize is double thick
11-13 09:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Meaning my case no longer fits on it
11-13 09:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I drop things, I need to order a normal thickness battery
11-13 12:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omg and now it's hot
11-13 12:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've got expedition weight thermals on
11-13 12:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Meeeeeelting
11-13 14:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Took back lots of the trail
11-13 14:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woot
11-13 14:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Fielded to the hilt
11-13 14:52 <Justin Kominar> 🙋
11-13 14:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah, good times
11-13 15:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey folks
11-13 15:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> @Sphoo7 is a great agent and doesn't want to be on hangouts but loves to play around campbell and lg and if yall do any builds,  please consider reaching out to invite him
11-13 15:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He also loves to smite ###### stuff
11-13 15:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He is very good guy and will be smashing up dtlg tonight
11-13 15:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Him and his brother muldrin
11-13 15:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If you see him out, join forces!
11-13 15:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He is very awesome
11-13 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He has met him, he was a dick to him too
11-13 15:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We're en route to kill his home portal
11-13 15:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Which is r8 with vr hack mods
11-13 15:44 <Justin Kominar> Do it quick, and don't hit anything on the way.  You have to go in quiet.  He's notorious for coming out and jarvising it when it's under threat.
11-13 15:45 <Justin Kominar> He's blocked me taking it out at least 3-4 times now by doing that.
11-13 15:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah we did it righf
11-13 15:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We dick flipped it too
11-13 15:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> L1/2 resos, 4 link amps, ada
11-13 15:59 <Brian Wiebe> Nice
11-13 16:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah we couldn't stop giggling
11-13 16:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 0
11-13 16:01 <Justin Kominar> It'll last an hour until they can Jarvis it back, but yeah - nice little mini-victory  ☺
11-13 16:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
11-13 16:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Super fun
11-13 16:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm leaving soon for the weekend
11-13 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sphoo7 knows he will now come for his stuff
11-13 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He is well aware of who simpleton is
11-13 16:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hah
11-13 16:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Kilosoraptor tried to take my home portal
11-13 16:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Came out stood in front of his car and recharged then shield defended
11-13 16:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He gave up and left!
11-13 16:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The axas probably made him give up
11-13 16:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I waved and smiled
11-13 16:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I never had one of the smurfs give up and drive off before
11-13 16:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Second mini victory!
11-13 16:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omg I'm like exhilarated or something
11-13 16:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That rocked
11-13 16:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> A smurf actually gave up
11-13 16:29 <Justin Kominar> Try to save your AXAs for anomalies in the future... drop the VR shields in those cases.
11-13 16:29 <Justin Kominar> Even if you're not going to attend them, you can donate to people that are.
11-13 16:29 <Justin Kominar> They're what help us dominate those events so much.
11-13 16:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh I am
11-13 16:29 <Justin Kominar> It's why I LOVE LOVE LOVE it when I blow up Seeker's AXAs all the time... because I know they're not going to smurf anomaly stockpiles any longer
11-13 16:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Those are the first axas I've put down in a while
11-13 16:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I almost never use em
11-13 16:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But
11-13 16:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm not going to the anomaly
11-13 16:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too much strife
11-13 16:31 <Justin Kominar> I do plan on attending, so I can mule your AXAs if you want.
11-13 16:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It would be too much of me being nervous and feeling like I should leave
11-13 16:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I can certainly send you and others along with some
11-13 16:33 <Justin Kominar> Totally fair .. but like I said, the gear can still be put to good use even if can't make it, so you still end up playing a part in our success.
11-13 16:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Had been saving them for just that reason
11-13 16:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I currently have 70 saved up
11-13 16:33 <Justin Kominar> awesome... more than me!
11-13 16:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Let's see how many more I can stockpile before then
11-13 16:34 <Justin Kominar> I think I'm up to 58
11-13 16:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah like I said, I almost never use em
11-13 16:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Would love for them to go to someone who will be at the anomaly
11-13 16:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone else having problems with the game
11-13 16:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Mayne I got bannned
11-13 16:57 <Maria la Gorda> I do. the app keeps crashing
11-13 16:57 <Maria la Gorda> & the lag is horrible
11-13 16:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Won't connect
11-13 16:57 <Maria la Gorda> I was cursing up & down the streets ot dtsj, in completing the SJ 48 misison
11-13 16:57 <Maria la Gorda> it took forever
11-13 16:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh nvm
11-13 16:57 <Maria la Gorda> it's like having bad sex
11-13 16:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Finally worked
11-13 16:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whew
11-13 16:59 <Justin Kominar> Fine here.
11-13 17:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I was worried I got banned but I think they at least email you when they ban you
11-13 18:02 <Matt Corley> I'll be in Los Altos tonight, so i'll be swinging through Los Gatos late ^_^
11-13 18:31 <Christy King> Yay Matt!! Hit it hard!
11-13 18:33 <Christy King> Bluefish, Sphoo7 does great work!! He doesn't want to join the LG chat? Cuz we can't really coordinate group attacks on comm since we know Seeker likes making green alts to spy.
11-13 18:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sphoo7 is one of my favorite local players,  he lives up the street from me
11-13 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He doesn't want to join any chat
11-13 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He has mostly been a solo player though his brother muldrin also plays
11-13 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Muldrin goes to China a lot for work but is currently here for I think another month
11-13 18:34 <Christy King> Oh good! If we plan something, you could just knock on his door and tell him what's up then. Still under Seeker's radar. ^_^
11-13 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah and he met seeker not knowing his work portal
11-13 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Went and parked in the lot
11-13 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> During business hours
11-13 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> LOL
11-13 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It didn't go super well
11-13 18:36 <Christy King> Oh geez! Sound the alarms!!! 🚨🚨🚨
11-13 18:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I have other means of communicating with him is text msgs
11-13 18:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I know I was like oh yeah? Parked huh
11-13 18:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Right in the lot during business hours
11-13 18:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hahahahahha
11-13 18:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We were so stealth today smashing his home portal
11-13 18:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We really didn't want him to jarvis
11-13 18:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And the dick flip was just icing on the cake
11-13 18:41 <Christy King> It always is. =)
11-13 18:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Haha he bumped to 7 but still has the link amps on it
11-13 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Easy smashing folks
11-13 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm at the airport
11-13 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Smash or make him waste more jarvis and ada
11-13 18:44 <Christy King> He jarvised it on Justin the other day so I made a few big LG fields off it. Simple was out there to smash it in under a minute. Hehe.
11-13 18:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-13 18:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I warned him no showing up on comms once we hit lark
11-13 18:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We also dinged his work portal a little on the way home
11-13 18:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It was grand!
11-13 18:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just grand!
11-13 18:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was right about today, it didn't suck
11-13 18:49 <Christy King> Yay!
11-13 18:49 <Christy King> I didn't see any Seeker family activity today, actually...
11-13 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Jenny appleseed came as close as a block away not long after
11-13 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But that was after my battle with kilosoraptor wherein I shield defended with 2 axas then muldrin and Sphoo7 came and threw vr shields on too
11-13 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> She might have seen the mods and been like yeah, lotta gear to kill that one
11-13 18:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or maybe she, god forbid, had some childcare duties to attend to
11-13 19:54 <Christy King> Haha
11-13 19:57 <Josh Lehan> At JCC. Nice campfire of Seeker portal. Will take down field but try not to hit it.
11-13 19:59 <Christy King> Hehehe
11-13 20:00 <Christy King> By the way, Bluefish, if you don't want to attend anomoly maybe you could get keys to be a recharger?
11-13 20:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh that was me and Sphoo7 s work!
11-13 20:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do like to recharge
11-13 20:00 <Christy King> And I too will gladly take gear for it. I can trade you for Vasona Park keys!
11-13 20:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think I gotta go airplane mode now
11-13 20:01 <Christy King> Have a good trip!
11-13 20:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Since the airplane is now off the ground
11-13 20:01 <Christy King> HAhahahaha
11-13 20:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah, back Sunday night and doing another week of evening shifts next week
11-13 20:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok had to do in flight wireless
11-13 20:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just heard about that attack in Paris!
11-13 21:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey which one of youse guys is krellan?
11-13 21:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whichever person here that is,  nice work down at jcc!
11-13 21:49 <Christy King> It's Josh.
11-13 21:49 <Christy King> Screenshot??
11-13 23:53 <Matt Corley> leaving Los Altos. gonna poke stuff in Los Gatos on my way home ^_^
11-13 23:56 <Justin Kominar> Thanks Matt!
11-13 23:56 <Paula E>  Who smashed lost altos
11-13 23:57 <Paula E> Los
11-14 00:01 <Paula E> FYI - we have two founder agents in downtown Saratoga that I geared up and got started yesterday. I just finished linking it up: all of it is L7 we are going to try t keep this maintained daily and link to LG
11-14 00:21 <Dave Marshall> Lilskuld
11-14 01:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lilskuld has been smashing dtla a lot lately
11-14 01:23 <Matt Corley> heh. so I met seeker tonight. that guy needs to chill out lol. I'll elaborate later after I rebuild some of Scotts Valley
11-14 01:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shit I might be drunk.  Goodnight
11-14 01:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey if anyone has a key to the old campbell bleachers portal can you please please please recharge it? Have watched 3 smurfs try to finish it off but it's not dead yet,  you have to get out of the car and walk across the running track to get to ot
11-14 10:30 <Brian Wiebe> If anyone is in LG simple is attacking the park but looks to be low on gear
11-14 10:31 <Brian Wiebe> Had trouble filling out portals and attacks were slow
11-14 13:47 <Matt Corley> simple is attacking Scotts Valley again because I attacked seeker's home portals last night ^_^;;
11-14 13:47 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Lol
11-14 13:48 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Recharge :o
11-14 13:48 <Matt Corley> simpleenough I meant
11-14 13:48 <Matt Corley> attacking sv
11-14 13:49 <Justin Kominar> Hard to keep all these simple-types straight  :P
11-14 14:13 <Matt Corley> so last night was fun. long story short - I attached lark ave, seeker comes out and finds me, accuses me of trespassing or spoofing to one of the creek trail portals, and I prove him wrong by showing him I can cap from the street. he said he was sorry and wrong about that.
11-14 14:13 <Matt Corley> man that guy needs to unwind =D
11-14 14:15 <Justin Kominar> Indeed
11-14 15:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So, you wanna hear one awesome thing about res in seattle?
11-14 15:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have yet to be called or treated like "a villainous traitor" for having flipped
11-14 15:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> They have greeted me warmly
11-14 15:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And the ones who don't like me haven't talked to me at all, they also haven't decided any portal I take they must come to immediately to smash
11-14 15:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm in strong blue territory right now
11-14 15:12 <Maria la Gorda> I'd forget about the smurfs in the silicon valley if that's how they treat me like that. I don't allow people with poor & abusive behavior to bring me down. Well maybe for a little bit but then I remember that they're not important in my life.
11-14 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's a different climate,  cross faction wise
11-14 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah this trip is helping clarify and solidify so much in my head about what I'm doing, what I wanna be doing, and what's important to me
11-14 15:13 <Maria la Gorda> I gotta run pick my bro at the airport. 
11-14 15:13 <Maria la Gorda> Have fun in Seattle  ☺
11-14 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Helping me figure out my path forward both with ingress and life
11-14 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
11-14 15:13 <Maria la Gorda> Hope the fog lifts for you soon 
11-14 15:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It already has started, I can see stuff in the distance now I couldn't see just a few days ago
11-14 15:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Feel like I haven't been able to breathe for months and can finally breathe
11-14 15:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways sorry,  shouldn't someone go smash up seeker again now :-)
11-14 15:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So, this is ingress talk just not local
11-14 15:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm at a coffee house in deep blue territory and sitting in range of 5 blue level 7 portals
11-14 15:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just started smashing one a little and the owner,  former teammate I know reasonably well, is very cordial, not pissed that I'm smashing a little, says go ahead it's cool I'll refield it later etc. Zero hostility,  none. He encouraged me to do it even
11-14 15:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How freakin refreshing
11-14 15:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Seriously,  with the kind of flack I'm catching in south bay for the flip I think ibwas somehow expecting the same here
11-14 15:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm way used to friendly cross faction stuff
11-14 15:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That I've messed some things up in south bay trying to think I could operate the same way down there. It really is just a game
11-14 15:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways
11-14 15:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just very different
11-14 16:38 <Justin Kominar> I think seeker is going for his onyx com blocker badge
11-14 16:38 <Justin Kominar> I finally joined the elite thousands!
11-14 16:48 <Lance Fanger> Lol
11-14 16:50 <Lance Fanger> Well he has blocked and unblocked me countless times so he will probably add you back :-)
11-14 17:07 <Brian Wiebe> Good one Justin!
11-14 17:08 <Christy King> Hahahahahaha
11-14 17:08 <Christy King> We should design that badge for him.
11-14 18:13 <Justin Kominar> ###
11-14 18:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Don't think he actually blocks anyone on comms
11-14 18:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> When I was falling out with res he was always telling me he had blocked me but then responding to stuff I said
11-14 18:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just more bullshit heh
11-14 18:19 <Justin Kominar> Still fun to make onyx badges for him though :po
11-14 18:35 <Lance Fanger> hehe someone should present the badge to him as the first honorary onyx com blocker
11-14 19:06 <Christy King> There was a great post someone shared in the SV L8 chat awhile ago, about how they were presenting a very special res with a very special badge. It was like an onyx stalker, but called something nice. Needs a post like that.
11-14 19:06 <Christy King> Nice design by the way!!
11-14 19:09 <Christy King> He either pretend blocks, or he blocks you but watches with his alt and then does a Jr high - ish "unblock - say some shit - block" maneuver.
11-14 20:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yup
11-14 20:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He actually has a name for this stuff
11-14 20:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He calls it psy-ops
11-14 21:37 <Matt Corley> im going to come up to lg now, cuz you know, someone's gotta wreck those simpleenough axa. and he tried to attack scotts valley today, so, game on =D
11-14 21:39 <Justin Kominar> I have no idea how that guy has been fed so many AXAs
11-14 21:40 <Justin Kominar> He doubles up on every portal he captures.
11-14 21:40 <Justin Kominar> I don't get it ...
11-14 21:42 <Justin Kominar> He's L9
11-14 21:42 <Justin Kominar> Not even a gold guardian yet
11-14 21:58 <Matt Corley> Probably fed by seeker, who has a stash in mufg
11-14 21:59 <Justin Kominar> Seeker uses his a lot too ...
11-14 21:59 <Justin Kominar> I popped 6 this weekend alone.
11-14 21:59 <Matt Corley> I guess when you're whole family hacks, it can add up
11-14 22:00 <Justin Kominar> And I see he replaced a bunch in Vasona park already.
11-14 22:00 <Matt Corley> well I'm about to pop 12 ^_^
11-14 22:00 <Justin Kominar> Well, 18 less in Oakland, as far as I'm concerned.  They can go nuts in LG
11-14 22:01 <Justin Kominar> I've Jarvis'd a bunch of SimpleEnough's, and then Seeker comes out half an hour later and blows them up for me  ;)
11-14 22:02 <Brian Wiebe> Could he just be leveling up another account?
11-14 22:03 <Brian Wiebe> Or are we sure it is a different person.
11-14 22:03 <Justin Kominar> No, we did some digging on SimpleEnough, and he seems like a legit non-###### human.
11-14 22:03 <Justin Kominar> He's actually an SVP at Wells-Fargo
11-14 22:04 <Brian Wiebe> Oh, so no direct relation to SS?
11-14 22:04 <Justin Kominar> Nope
11-14 22:04 <Justin Kominar> Just an uncanny coincidence, it would seem.
11-14 22:05 <Brian Wiebe> Seems fishy
11-14 22:06 <Brian Wiebe> Maybe it's was encouraged so we don't just call him simple
11-14 22:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I don't think it seems fishy. Picking a gamer name similar to someone else's name or to game ideas happens in other games often enough. :)
11-14 22:07 <Justin Kominar> Unless we're being played, there was G+ post made that implied that SimpleEnough didn't know anyone playing in LG before he made contact with Seeker & Co...  so ... likely not, but, maybe?
11-14 22:09 <Brian Wiebe> Christy and I also saw a simpleEAK or something similar recently
11-14 22:09 <Christy King> ###
11-14 22:10 <Christy King> Oops wrong one!
11-14 22:11 <Christy King> ###
11-14 22:12 <Christy King> EakSeeker
11-14 22:13 <Christy King> I think near Santana Row but could've been elsewhere
11-14 22:14 <Christy King> SimpleEnough sounds like the kind of name someone could come up with to be pun-y. And we've seen that account in Saratoga while Simple was in LG.
11-14 22:14 <Christy King> But, not surprisingly, the Simples became friends. Haha.
11-14 22:15 <Christy King> EakSeeker is a stranger name. I don't know enough about that account.
11-14 22:16 <Christy King> But Seeker's last known alt was TheLetterZ (enl account which is since deleted) which is nothing like SimpleSeeker so he's smart enough to know not to make it obvious.
11-14 22:17 <Christy King> Oh, and: Get 'em Matt!!! =D=D=D=D
11-14 23:40 <Matt Corley> 15 less AXA in Los Gatos ;P
11-15 00:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> eakseeker live in japan town (SJ) mostly plays around there, wendy and I met him when he was new 
11-15 11:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have a true couch portal here in seattle at my friend aron apt
11-15 11:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> In range from inside,  and I'm in deep blue territory,  but no one has attacked my couch portal the whole time I've been here
11-15 11:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And they all definitely know I'm here, it's been nice
11-15 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I went smashing a little bit yesterday but I kinda don't have the heart to do a smashing spree
11-15 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I kinda like these folks too much heh
11-15 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I might be a sucky enl agent if I lived here
11-15 11:11 <Christy King> Unless they want the ap from redoing it?
11-15 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's on a side street that is also a dead end
11-15 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Went out last night and recapped my old couch portal
11-15 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was fun
11-15 13:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh palko if you're free tomorrow daytime let's go bump dtla, I'll pay for gas
11-15 13:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I see Sphoo7 is hitting lg again
11-15 13:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He was pretty inspired when I told him seeker says he owns all of lg
11-15 13:38 <Christy King> Exxxxxcellent
11-15 18:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well, that was a fine trip back to the old stomping grounds
11-15 18:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Restored my faith in human beings quite a bit, reminded me of what I came here for, and gave me some great ideas for how to make this transition into this new land smoother
11-15 19:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Refreshed and recharged,  ready to dive back in, definitely ready for some more ingress.  Not too interested in paying much mind about those who take this game way too personally,  though I've made mental note of who NOT to play monopoly and other games with :-)
11-15 23:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do know o tall a lot, I'm sorry if it overwhelms
11-16 07:18 <Christy King> Mmm, can't wait to put a little green back in LG today! 😊
11-16 09:24 <Maria la Gorda> Hi everyone, I accepted a job offer. I'm happy & sad at the same time. happy because it's in the field I want to be working in & sad because I will be moving to the east coast in mid december. I've met many wonderful people on Ingress & I will miss you all. 
11-16 09:32 <Justin Kominar> Well that is bittersweet news, but congrats!
11-16 09:32 <Maria la Gorda> Thx Justin
11-16 09:33 <Justin Kominar> We never even met, but I loved seeing you on the portals around LG
11-16 09:33 <Maria la Gorda> Thx, i played more in LG before my horrible ankle sprain. It healed but not completely
11-16 10:12 <Paula E> What are the two Josh's agent names?
11-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> Krellan
11-16 10:13 <Justin Kominar> and ...

11-16 10:24 <Christy King> Krellan and Palko

11-16 14:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Parallel monolog it is!
11-16 14:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Do you want a ride to LG?
11-16 14:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wanted to ingress with you man
11-16 14:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's ok
11-16 14:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I understand but I'm limited time.  I guess I can pick you up.  Deploy on the park.  Then take you back home
11-16 14:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have work soon also

11-16 14:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> My car hasn't been in my name and I bought it weeks ago
11-16 14:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's fine, no problem here
11-16 14:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nap time,  l8r
11-16 15:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think tomorrow I'll make the 2 hour trek to dtla to bump it
11-16 15:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> After that I'll hit up lg if time allows
11-16 18:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wow
11-16 18:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have amazing friends
11-16 18:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I really do
11-16 18:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm grateful
11-16 18:27 <Christy King> Who turned legacy white, haha?
11-16 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not it!
11-16 18:38 <Maria la Gorda> Who's coming to dtla? We;re short on L8 peeps to make an L8 farm
11-16 18:38 <Maria la Gorda> & I'm low on gear
11-16 18:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maria you wanna do a late night dtla thing maybe?
11-16 18:43 <Maria la Gorda> this one is scheduled at 8pm
11-16 18:44 <Maria la Gorda> are you working evening still?
11-16 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ah, I don't get advanced knowledge of those, was just thinking after work
11-16 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah am working
11-16 18:44 <Maria la Gorda> I haven't seen an invite for a later one unfortunately
11-16 18:45 <Maria la Gorda> & I haven't slept in weeks
11-16 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Um I kinda meant outside of anything official
11-16 18:45 <Maria la Gorda> my body is completely feeling the exhaustion
11-16 18:46 <Maria la Gorda> I'm sorry, I won't be able to do late tonight. Too exhausted
11-16 18:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cool np
11-16 18:50 <Christy King> Yeah, I could see you not wanting to do the group thing... good call!
11-16 18:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Who was that to?
11-16 18:50 <Christy King> Why are your friends so amazing? 😊
11-16 18:51 <Christy King> You!
11-16 18:51 <Christy King> I wouldn't either in your showles. I don't know who would be there but some of them aren't very friendly towards you.
11-16 18:52 <Christy King> In your shoes
11-16 18:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am sorry
11-16 18:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not trying to be anything
11-16 18:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was just happy for a minute
11-16 19:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause I got pleasantly surprised by a former teammate and friend who doesn't hate me for flipping who doesn't hate me at all
11-16 19:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Doesn't hate me not even after I spazzed on him and got out of his car in my jammies and took a bus home
11-16 19:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause his driving was scary and bad
11-16 19:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause he allows for me to be imperfect
11-16 19:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's what blows my mind
11-16 19:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Everyone here seems to not want to allow me to be affected by what's gone on
11-16 19:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like I'm some machine
11-16 19:06 <Christy King> Haha, the people in the bus must have given you some funny looks.
11-16 19:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What bus
11-16 19:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh
11-16 19:07 <Christy King> The one in your jammies
11-16 19:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah the bus
11-16 19:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah some funny looks
11-16 19:08 <Christy King> Cute jammies at least?
11-16 19:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It happens, I didn't feel safe in his car.  he didn't take that to mean I thought he's a jerk
11-16 19:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just I didn't feel safe in his car
11-16 19:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He never held it against me
11-16 19:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Purple w polka-dot
11-16 19:09 <Christy King> That's good that he got that you were just upset at his actions and not at him. That is hard for a lot of people to seperate!
11-16 19:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Exactly
11-16 19:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Exactly
11-16 19:10 <Christy King> On a totally seperate line... was SimpleSeeker going soft today or just out of gear???
11-16 19:10 <Christy King> He took out YSI portals but left them all white
11-16 19:11 <Christy King> And took out Eriks, stuck around, but didn't really defend when Zach took it back.
11-16 19:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry I didn't mean to imply folks here are less than amazing
11-16 19:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yall rock, good ingress teammates!
11-16 19:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do love the team
11-16 20:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But as much as we're good teammates I think we're just that and I have maybe tried to have it be more than that with some of yall
11-16 20:14 <Justin Kominar> Blue: incoming field from my neck  of the woods
11-16 20:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Teammates you guys are awesome
11-16 20:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Is all
11-16 20:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anchored where justin
11-16 20:16 <Justin Kominar> Fuck.  Seeker JUST popped it
11-16 20:16 <Christy King> That ~@~
11-16 20:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've got to call a customer now but can maybe help smash local anchors soon
11-16 20:20 <Justin Kominar> Bah...  S9m2one threw a blocker...
11-16 20:21 <Justin Kominar> Can't remember throw now
11-16 20:21 <Justin Kominar> Rethrow, rather
11-16 20:40 <Justin Kominar> Ah, maybe that explains the hit mission in me...  He's out in your neck of the woods now,  so perhaps I was the one blocking him in Campbell
11-16 21:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So
11-16 21:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I see field over me anchor 2 blocks up
11-16 21:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can go smash
11-16 21:09 <Justin Kominar> The blocker he (or someone) threw was from netflix
11-16 21:18 <Christy King> Smash! Smash! Smash!
11-16 21:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Down
11-16 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Threw some fields too
11-16 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whee
11-16 21:47 <Josh Lehan> https://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/fol/Pages/fol-one-day-walk-through.aspx
11-16 21:48 <Josh Lehan> We should all do this
11-16 21:48 <Justin Kominar> oh hell yeah
11-16 21:49 <Justin Kominar> We missed it last year, and I just couldn't stomach waiting in the car to go through it.  Would rather walk it.
11-16 21:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll go
11-16 21:51 <Josh Lehan> I'm glad they added the one walk-through night per year, I remember when it was drive-through only and that disappointed me
11-17 09:21 <Christy King> Can anyone hit the Vasona Dam? I can go that way at lunch time, but I'd rather his fields not make another cp.
11-17 10:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Will go smash post office
11-17 10:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That will clear a bit
11-17 10:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And is on the way to an appt
11-17 11:04 <Christy King> Yayyy!
11-17 11:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Uno momento portal favor
11-17 11:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Haha autocorrect
11-17 11:36 <Christy King> Your phone knows!!
11-17 11:36 <Christy King> It's been ingress-ified! Haha
11-17 11:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna jarvis barracuda,  don't want to deal with mister sunshine
11-17 11:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Blocking link
11-17 11:41 <Justin Kominar> Nice... he totally bummed me out last night when I was on my dog walk and was gonna field up to you.
11-17 11:41 <Justin Kominar> I should have completed the field immediately, but I assumed it would be safe for 15 mins while I completed my usual walking route... and he snuck in in that window and took it down then inkleination threw a blocker  :(
11-17 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well shit is down now
11-17 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo
11-17 11:55 <Justin Kominar> 🙌
11-17 12:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omg
11-17 12:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 10 90 studios has never ONCE given me a key
11-17 12:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not even once
11-17 12:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll wait another 5 min but it's still not gonna pony up a damn key
11-17 12:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omfg finally!
11-17 12:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gotta go finish this up before cp
11-17 12:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Done
11-17 12:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too bad my appt is tomorrow heh
11-17 12:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Be cool if any of what I just did makes cp
11-17 12:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Would also like to make leader board
11-17 12:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Looks good over by saratoga,  nice fields whoever threw em
11-17 12:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We should gather as a group to field
11-17 12:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Meet at a coffee place, look at Intel,  assign folks out to areas and go
11-17 12:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Connect the saratoga stuff to lg and south campbell
11-17 12:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone interested?
11-17 12:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We could in theory make a truckload of mu
11-17 12:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't like 1 mu fields and wanna be part of helping make million mu fields
11-17 12:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't even need to be the one throwing em
11-17 12:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh weird
11-17 12:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Travisbickle407 his John Morgan park this am, not his normal area at all
11-17 13:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hope it's cause he got laid or something and had to drive home
11-17 13:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause if anyone needs a tension release,  it's that guy
11-17 13:02 <Maria la Gorda> I need a punching bag...
11-17 13:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Definitely hope it's not some new job commute thing
11-17 13:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hope that's not in reference to what I just said!
11-17 13:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause Travisbickle407 isn't worth punching!  At all!
11-17 13:05 <Maria la Gorda> No, I really need a punching bag to release the bad energy I've been absorbing from racist assholes... They just piss me off... Although the racism aimed at me
11-17 13:05 <Maria la Gorda> *Racism isn't aimed at me
11-17 13:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It doesn't have to be
11-17 13:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bigotry raises my ire quite a bit
11-17 13:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I grew up around a lot of racist jerks
11-17 13:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Always knew it was wrong
11-17 13:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Has always made my stomach turn
11-17 13:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm white, I know that I have no idea what it's like to face any of that
11-17 13:09 <Maria la Gorda> Yeah, I just need to let it go... They exist everywhere & I can't change their behavior
11-17 13:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I just know it's wrong and makes me sick and angry
11-17 13:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-17 13:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You cant
11-17 13:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Best you can do is hope they don't breed
11-17 13:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whoa I made it to 8 on leader board!
11-17 13:15 <Justin Kominar> Nice work!
11-17 13:17 <Maria la Gorda> Congrats on making leader board 
11-17 13:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks! Didn't expect 8
11-17 13:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Glad the fields made cp too
11-17 13:44 <Christy King> Wooh!!
11-17 13:45 <Christy King> Wooh for fields making cp and making #8. Not for racist jerks. In case that wasn't clear! =D
11-17 13:50 <Justin Kominar> btw - tickets purchased for Dec 5th park walk-through.  I'll be there.
11-17 13:50 <Justin Kominar> Will be with family and some friends too though, so primary mission is not ingress ... (but secondary is  ;)
11-17 14:23 <Christy King> Woot!!
11-17 14:43 <Maria la Gorda> Anyone in LG available to smash these portals/fields?
###
11-17 15:47 <Christy King> Lodge Bear? That's tough for me because I'd have to exit out the back gate after work and swing around, but if no one else can I will do that.
11-17 15:55 <Justin Kominar> I *might* be able to get it later tonight.  That's an annoying portal to anchor off of though ... hope they don't start using it regularly.
11-17 17:15 <Christy King> If we crush it fairly quickly, they probably wont. Esp since they don't have someone sitting there to guard it.
11-17 17:52 <Christy King> Anyone hit the lodge by chance?
11-17 18:15 <Lance Fanger> I did
11-17 18:16 <Christy King> Yay! Then I'll work on LG Blvd a little
11-17 18:16 <Brian Wiebe> Are you guys getting double ap? I seem to be getting it here in LA.
11-17 18:19 <Christy King> I think so!
11-17 18:19 <Christy King> ###
11-17 18:19 <Christy King> ###
11-17 18:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula that was a mighty fine ingress time today,  thanks!
11-17 20:36 <Paula E> @Maria would you like to get together so you can vent? I promise I wont tell you what to do 
11-17 20:43 <Paula E> @ Bluefish, it was too bad I was only for a couple hours.
11-17 20:44 <Lance Fanger> People use vent for ingress?
11-17 20:49 <Paula E> I use ingress for a variety of reasons. It's proven to be useful for anger mgmt as well >.<
11-17 20:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula I had fun
11-17 20:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> A lot
11-17 20:52 <Matt Corley> people don't use vent for ingress, Zello is common for voice chat
11-17 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Matt I don't think paula knows about vent
11-17 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> She seemed to be using the dictionary word vent
11-17 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not the technology word
11-17 20:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ie venting
11-17 20:54 <Matt Corley> I know, was just clearing up the earlier question
11-17 20:55 <Matt Corley> which Lance asked
11-17 20:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol ok
11-17 20:55 <Paula E> I was offering Maria a listening ear regarding her racism comment earlier. 
11-17 20:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah paula I understood that
11-17 20:57 <Paula E> I was offering the explanation to Matt and/or Lance. 
11-17 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula, vent is another kind of chat service
11-17 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like mumble
11-17 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If you didn't know
11-17 20:58 <Paula E> Omg let it go', sorry I said anything.
11-17 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sorry
11-17 21:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just saw an opportunity for folks to get confused and tried to explain

11-18 13:21 <Josh Lehan> My work super busy now and my manager needs to see more ass-in-chair time unfortunately, so that puts a crimp in my ability to fix Vasona during the nice afternoons
11-18 13:21 <Justin Kominar> Is your chair a .... rolling chair?  ;)
11-18 14:10 <Christy King> Anyone know about Durka85? Just hit Vasona near YSI.

11-18 18:25 <Paula E> Christy yes!! I would love to
11-18 18:33 <Justin Kominar> Cleared out about a third of downtown just now
11-18 19:05 <Christy King> I'll check with Brian when he gets hime. When are you free?
11-18 19:07 <Paula E> Anytime after 7;30
11-18 20:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Uhh
11-18 20:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ugh
11-18 20:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess I am not biking to saratoga after work for sweet sweet farming
11-18 20:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sux,monkey butt

11-18 20:18 <Paula E> I'm on my way recharge
11-18 20:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Simple enough

11-18 20:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ugh, furu Sato back to blue minus that multi hack
11-18 20:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Boo I say boo
11-18 20:28 <Christy King> You talking Saratoga area along Hwy 9?
11-18 20:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Downtown saratoga
11-18 20:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's was ep8
11-18 20:31 <Christy King> What part of Saratoga is downtown? I'm really only familiar with Saratoga Ave and Hwy 9. Tell me where to go. ☺
11-18 20:31 <Christy King> Brian and I can go for a little bit at least.
11-18 20:33 <Christy King> While I'm asking dumb questions: Is the Hwy 9 area called downtown or old town or historic town or uptown...? Haha, so many options? We refer to it as downtown Saratoga at work, but I think we might be off since nine of us live there.
11-18 20:34 <Christy King> Not nine, sorry. None. None of us live there. Very different.
11-18 20:34 <Christy King> Haha
11-18 20:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm dumber
11-18 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Saratoga state Bank
11-18 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anything within half a click of that
11-18 20:39 <Brian Wiebe> I'm dumberer
11-18 20:39 <Christy King> Here?
11-18 20:40 <Christy King> ###
11-18 20:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yes
11-18 20:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wasteland?
11-18 20:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Saratoga bell still 8
11-18 20:44 <Christy King> K, that's at Hwy 9 and LG-Saratoga Rd. We'll tool around there for a little bit. Then grab some grub. Brian is hungry.
11-18 20:44 <Christy King> Or hangry, haha.
11-18 20:46 <Christy King> ###
11-18 20:46 <Christy King> ###
11-18 20:47 <Christy King> Paula, let me know if you had somewhere else in mind. Where do you most need 8s?
11-18 20:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Digh
11-18 20:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sigh
11-18 21:01 <Brian Wiebe> I like the pirate one.
11-18 21:04 <Paula E> Yes that's the place but they've already taken it out 
11-18 21:04 <Paula E> We can meet at Saratoga library
11-18 21:05 <Brian Wiebe> Near 8
11-18 21:05 <Brian Wiebe> Near 85?
11-18 21:06 <Paula E> Yes and west valley 
11-18 21:06 <Paula E> Meet at the post office ok
11-18 21:07 <Brian Wiebe> OK just passing westgate. Where is that?
11-18 21:10 <Paula E> You know what I'd rather take Saratoga back from them, meet me here. We'll show them who's boss 
11-18 21:15 <Brian Wiebe> At the post office
11-18 21:17 <Paula E> Be right there
11-18 23:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula around?
11-19 06:57 <Christy King> We stopped around 11
11-19 11:55 <Christy King> Anyone know tealsock?
11-19 11:57 <Paula E> Yes her husband is right sock works at Google I've met her husband not not her
11-19 11:58 <Christy King> Oh cool! She swung by the park today! Is she a LG person or was she just out exploring?
11-19 12:03 <Paula E>  Exploring I think Cupertino. Her hubby is a very active bicyclist. 
11-19 13:16 <Christy King> Oh gotcha. Cool!
11-19 14:06 <Paula E> If you do not hear from me I'm taking orders finding that Elsa Reno open space preserve myself I am lost
11-19 14:09 <Maria la Gorda> Where is that???
11-19 14:12 <Paula E> Los gatos iOS sorry used the mic. El Sereno open space preserve
11-19 14:13 <Paula E> ###
11-19 14:14 <Maria la Gorda> I think I got lost there a couple of weeks ago....
11-19 14:44 <Christy King> Don't worry. Brian and I do Search and Rescue! =)
11-19 14:45 <Paula E> Oh that's good to know. I feel safe already. I'm in my car going to get my son. I unfortunately had to give up and you know how I HATE to do that. Save it for another day. 
11-19 14:51 <Josh Lehan> I snuck off during lunch today to build some quick Vasona but only got as far as train station, deployed some crap hack mods around to avoid shining a spotlight on YSI 
11-19 14:55 <Christy King> No problem. Tealsock came through and pumped a lot of green into the park too. It's looking good!
11-19 14:55 <Christy King> I went up to subway near 85 for lunch and linked back to the dam and eriks for some nice fields. =)
11-19 16:22 <Christy King> This is odd...
11-19 16:22 <Christy King> ###
11-19 16:22 <Christy King> ###
11-19 16:22 <Christy King> ###
11-19 16:23 <Christy King> Im on Pretend Ignore so I doubt I'll hear back.
11-19 18:05 <Christy King> No reply, but he just *happened* to fully deploy on one portal right after, haha.
11-19 18:43 <Lance Fanger> Well I just had a fun chat with simple :-)
11-19 18:50 <Maria la Gorda> What did he say?
11-19 20:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dude he acted off today
11-19 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was all over the dog park area and post office down to oka lane getting all the ap
11-19 20:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And pulled up to post office on dell at one point to link and realized a minute later post office was getting hit,  by ######, and that I was 20 or so feet behind his car
11-19 20:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I recharged and made my links then went back to the trail, page dam
11-19 20:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And normally he'd wipe anything nearby with my name on it
11-19 20:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But all he did from there was ada the library and left the rest of all that alone
11-19 20:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Only portal I didn't touch was his work portal,  didn't need it for my little plans
11-19 22:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Still, seemed off,  not his normal bs
11-20 07:58 <Christy King> Yeah, he went through the park a couple times but left it all white each time. Normally he makes everything blue with heavy shields.
11-20 07:59 <Christy King> He did go through the park during the day, when you'd expect a person to be working. Maybe he got fired??
11-20 07:59 <Christy King> Or maybe Lance talked him out of being a jerk! Lance, what did you guys talk about??
11-20 09:29 <Maria la Gorda> Totally got a scare from the SJPD this AM. I received a call from a police officer, informing me that they found my shcool ID, CC, DB & junk jewelry (as he called it) in ESJ. He asked if my home or my car has recently been broken into, & he came to my residence to show me the stolen property. Thank God, it wasn't me. 
11-20 11:23 <Christy King> Whoa.
11-20 11:23 <Christy King> Was it an ID with your name on it?
11-20 13:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey lg peeps
11-20 13:28 <Christy King> Zup?
11-20 13:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna ingress my ass off today then more over the weekend,  any lg plans happening for any group builds or smashing runs?
11-20 13:30 <Christy King> Not yet...
11-20 13:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whoa maria that would have freaked me out!
11-20 13:30 <Christy King> But if we can get a group together, that sounds super fun!
11-20 13:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Okay, let me know and I might come hit lg with some folks
11-20 13:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gotta see what my pal sphoo is up to as well
11-20 13:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Do we have enough for a build?
11-20 13:32 <Christy King> Enough people? If everyone came, yeah. So far, the most we've had at once was 4 or 5, but man it was fun.
11-20 13:33 <Christy King> We split into groups to green up more places and make it harder for Simple to follow and destroy. =)
11-20 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-20 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I like the idea of splitting up into groups and closing in on him
11-20 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The follower becomes the followed!
11-20 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hehe
11-20 13:39 <Christy King> And Paula has brought up the idea if a field from Saratoga to LG to... maybe Campbell? We should definitely start planing that out. I can throw links from Vasona as its closing (or after, as I'm leaving work). Maybe Paula can throw from the cemetery in Saratoga, since that's locked up at night. And then we would just need a hard anchor in Campbell or somewhere... and clearing lanes. Ideas on a 3rd anchor??
11-20 13:40 <Justin Kominar> I don't know that there are too many hard anchor points in Campbell  :(
11-20 13:47 <Christy King> Just need something closed at night.
11-20 13:48 <Christy King> Or if not Campbell, somewhere else around??
11-20 13:49 <Christy King> Somewhere smurfs can't access at night.
11-20 13:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or someone on our side willing to trespass
11-20 13:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> *looks around the room, tries to see who might fit that descripyion*
11-20 13:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah that's me
11-20 13:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
11-20 13:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was on the trail last weekend at night
11-20 13:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'd totally love for simpleton or anyone else calling the cops to report me for that
11-20 13:55 <Justin Kominar> This could be a fun anchor...  signal's really bad up there: 

###
11-20 13:55 <Justin Kominar> Then just find something hard in the mountains on a trail somewhere, and somewhere in Saratoga.
11-20 13:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's not like cops are gonna come find you on the trail at night,  I mean, how would they even find you
11-20 13:55 <Justin Kominar> Doesn't really cover LG/Campbell, mind you ... but could be a hard field to take out.
11-20 13:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I must have passed 25 or 30 people that night also on the trail
11-20 13:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How would they know which one was you and if they're pulling you off the trail at night for trespassing,  they'd have to pull everyone
11-20 13:57 <Justin Kominar> It's stupid that the trail is closed at sunset... back home where I'm from, all trails like that are open 24/7.
11-20 13:58 <Justin Kominar> I can only imagine they must have had lots of issues with violence on them at night or something, since they're not fully lit most of the way ...
11-20 13:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah to me it's the equivalent of a road
11-20 13:58 <Justin Kominar> ^ precisely
11-20 14:01 <Christy King> I have seen the rangers pull off the road at night, shine their giant bright light down at the dam, and yell at some kids that it was closed and wait there until the kids left. They were just fishing.
11-20 14:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Where I get on the trail is at the end of a dead end road
11-20 14:03 <Christy King> I doubt it was violence or concern of a terrorist attack, or they'd actually fence it off. More likely worry about graffiti or hover mom's worrying there COULD be violence... or sex!
11-20 14:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> One night close to midnight recently I went to get on the trail and there were like 6 cop cars there, lights going,  the works, they were pulling over and arresting some dude but they were blocking the trail entrance
11-20 14:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So I went up to one of the less busy officers and asked ok to get on the trail from here?
11-20 14:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Officer was quite nice, told me sure, just go around their little situation they were working
11-20 14:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So hey
11-20 14:04 <Christy King> Hahaha
11-20 14:05 <Christy King> They totally don't care
11-20 14:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If a cop at midnight tells me I can bypass their incident and get on the traik
11-20 14:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That it's fine
11-20 14:05 <Christy King> I don't think the whole trail closes. Just Vasona park.
11-20 14:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No, I looked this up pretty thoroughly
11-20 14:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The trail is actually closed too
11-20 14:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I bet cops care more about people having after hours parties in the parks than they do someone biking along the trail
11-20 14:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wonder if that makes mall parking lots trespassing when the mall is closed
11-20 14:45 <Josh Lehan> In Vasona now, have some limited time to do something
11-20 14:46 <Dave Marshall> The kotani en plaque is on private property, there's a sign just before you get there that says no trespassing.
11-20 14:46 <Justin Kominar> @Josh - may I suggest ... Ingress?
11-20 14:47 <Dave Marshall> I went to claim it about a month ago 
11-20 14:47 <Justin Kominar> @dave You can reach it from the road though.
11-20 14:47 <Justin Kominar> I smashed it ones, and managed to get one resonator on it once.. but my service was so bad out there, I just couldn't even complete a full deploy.
11-20 14:47 <Justin Kominar> s/ones/once/
11-20 14:47 <Dave Marshall> Only with some awesome drift.... I was too far out 
11-20 14:48 <Dave Marshall> I had fairly good signal at the time 
11-20 14:48 <Justin Kominar> Guess I got lucky.  It was late, pitch black, and I totally felt like I shouldn't be there, even though I was on a public road and not on private property  ☺
11-20 14:49 <Dave Marshall> Ya, it's someone's driveway.  Complete with basketball hoop.  Maybe I lost signal and didn't know it? I'll have to try again 
11-20 14:50 <Josh Lehan> There are some private property portals in Hayward, one is EP8 :)
11-20 14:50 <Josh Lehan> Reachable from street though
11-20 14:51 <Josh Lehan> Ingress is super slow. Anybody else notice this also? Or is T-Mobile just throttling me again?
11-20 14:52 <Brian Wiebe> It's been rather slow for me lately as well.
11-20 14:52 <Justin Kominar> Oh ... is THAT what the 'T' stands for?!
11-20 14:52 <Justin Kominar> /me has always wondered ...
11-20 15:54 <Josh Lehan> Maybe - did what I could in the park, annoying badly timed work meeting ahead, sigh 
11-20 16:00 <Christy King> Yay Josh! Thanks for the park visit!
11-20 16:01 <Christy King> Your ranger friend was around today. Did you see him? =)
11-20 16:45 <Paula E> Im in for anything tonight.Can be available in 30'min
11-20 17:17 <Christy King> Hmm, I guess he wanted me to know he was here. After sunset. How cute.
11-20 17:17 <Christy King> ###
11-20 17:17 <Christy King> ###
11-20 17:29 <Christy King> Paula, not sure if I could do much tonight. Pretty tired. But perhaps after work next Monday or Tuesday?
11-20 17:50 <Paula E> Absolutely. Let me know
11-20 17:52 <Christy King> Team? Who else is up for a Monday or Tuesday portal extravaganza? Which night?
11-20 18:07 <Maria la Gorda> I'm game if it's after 9pm
11-20 18:14 <Josh Lehan> Hi again - did not step inside - had limited time and was racing to get back for meeting 
11-20 18:15 <Josh Lehan> Sigh, meeting time really bad this time of year as it shuts me down from the critical dusk time which seals the portals in the park - I noticed RES appeared just then 
11-20 18:22 <Christy King> Yeah, even Simpleton was in the park after dark!
11-20 18:31 <Josh Lehan> Sneaky 
11-20 18:32 <Josh Lehan> Maybe he figures if nobody cares then he can do it too - would be funny if he was actually caught :) 
11-20 19:02 <Christy King> I would laugh my ass off.
11-20 19:23 <Josh Lehan> Wow new players? meltastic Farmount dvduer
11-20 19:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And now I'm level 13
11-20 19:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo
11-20 19:35 <Maria la Gorda> Congrats on 13!
11-20 19:37 <Josh Lehan> Excellent work Agent! I am fast approaching 13 also
11-20 19:37 <Josh Lehan> If Seeker shows up then I can get it tonight :)
11-20 19:37 <Josh Lehan> Who rebuilt YSI just after dusk? Nice
11-20 19:40 <Josh Lehan> I want to make a habit of taking a lunch walk up to YSI and building that - Then you have hack mods all afternoon
11-20 19:41 <Josh Lehan> I have some spare time to kill while waiting traffic to clear - will walk the Roberts Road loop and kill some blue there
11-20 19:46 <Christy King> Meltastic is my coworker. =)
11-20 19:47 <Christy King> Her and I rebuilt just before we left work today.
11-20 19:48 <Christy King> I think I've seen Farmount's name before, here and there. Dvduer is new to me. If they are LG folks, we should try to meet and add to the HO!
11-20 19:50 <Christy King> Also if anyone meets Bloodwinter, I see that name all over LG but I don't think he/she is in the HOs. If you get a chance to say hi, it would be awesome to connect!
11-20 19:53 <Christy King> Bluefish, Congrats on L13!!! You just went up a level on the 3rd year badge, too!
11-20 19:53 <Christy King> Josh, that would be AWESOME to have some portal bumping at YSI!! Hack mods, YES!
11-20 20:17 <Josh Lehan> Agreed - Nice
11-20 20:29 <Josh Lehan> SamuraiXaq: Just bumped Stove to 7
11-20 20:34 <Zach Crawford> Awesome
11-20 20:34 <Zach Crawford> ###
11-20 20:34 <Zach Crawford> Los Gatos Blvd 
11-20 20:58 <Christy King> 👍
11-20 21:45 <Zach Crawford> Looks like Simple used an ADA to take Erik's. 
11-20 21:49 <Maria la Gorda> Smurf's signature... Is that all they do?
11-20 22:36 <Christy King> That's Simple's favorite game plan, at least.
11-21 21:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey folks
11-21 21:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone near campbell or lg want to team up or does anyone need help fighting off blue scourge?
11-21 23:00 <Paula E> I wish, I'm not available atm 
11-21 23:01 <Paula E> I stopped at the park en route the market and my mom had a cow. Fun suck
11-22 01:46 <Christy King> Paula, is Krokodile the same as Periplum?
11-22 01:48 <Christy King> Periplum and Ulula are the two Saratoga/LG enls with founders badges you mentioned, right? If you've met them and want to add them to LG HO, that sounds good to me!
11-22 02:19 <Matt Corley> ive heard of the periplum name before
11-22 03:04 <Paula E> Christy yes they are the same
11-22 03:09 <Paula E> Christy Bloodwinter and wife forgot agent name live up at lupine lodge I've met BW. We were in LG sane time last night when I was working on this
11-22 03:09 <Paula E> ###
11-22 08:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula,  freakin awesome!
11-22 08:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So, folks,  whoever happens to see this,  gonna talk to christy about adding Sphoo7 to this hangout,  he's my neighbor and plays lots around here and lg
11-22 08:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy asked if we should add him but didn't think he did hangouts.  He does and would in fact like to be added. He's definitely one of my favorite local players,  very chill dude, but likes to smash up simpletons shit as much as the rest of us
11-22 08:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yay add them up!
11-22 08:57 <Maria la Gorda> 👍
11-22 08:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can I add or do I let christy do the honors?
11-22 08:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok cool, he's really quite awesome,  both as teammate and as person
11-22 09:50 <Maria la Gorda> I think you can add if you have the option of adding people. I add people after I've met them in person... 
11-22 09:50 <Maria la Gorda> Who's going to the BYO tshirt printing tonight, for the green ink (7:40-8:10pm)? 
11-22 10:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I work tonight but didn't know about it
11-22 10:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> fuckoffadric  your working nights still?
11-22 10:18 <Justin Kominar> I met periplum and ulula in Saratoga coming home from work on Friday.  We had a good chat.  Seem like good folks.
11-22 10:19 <Justin Kominar> Their desk portal(s)  are the Joshua mining carts in old downtown Saratoga, so make a point of topping those ones up in particular if passing through.
11-22 10:29 <Maria la Gorda> I'm not able to go to the inking party at that time, so was wondering if I can get tshirts to those who are going...
11-22 12:13 <Christy King> Nice fields Paula!!
11-22 12:14 <Justin Kominar> I'm on my way out to wildwood park in Saratoga with the fam, so I'll reclaim that area.
11-22 12:15 <Christy King> Yes, please add Sphoo7! And his brother if they're both in LG. =) Easier for you to add since he's in your circles already
11-22 12:15 <Christy King> Paula, same to you! If you have contact info for Periplum, Ulula, Bloodwinter, and his wife and they want to add, please add!
11-22 12:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Bloodwinter and Onlyjaws?
11-22 12:18 <Christy King> I don't recognize Onlyjaws, is that his wife? If she's enl and in LG, I'm on board. =)
11-22 12:34 <Matt Corley> theonlyjaws is bloodwinter's wife
11-22 12:39 <Christy King> Cool!
11-22 16:54 <Josh Lehan> I am going to the T-shirt thing tonight at Hacker Dojo then DTLA build after
11-22 20:47 <Josh Lehan> ###
11-22 20:47 <Josh Lehan> ###
11-22 20:48 <Josh Lehan> Going to anomaly? The hotel room deal closed today :( so hope you got room if staying up there 
11-23 13:32 <Christy King> Anyone want to work on LG tonight or tomorrow night after work?
11-23 16:35 <Paula E> What time are you thinking Christie?
11-23 17:27 <Christy King> I'm usually free around 5:30.
11-23 17:28 <Christy King> Since no one else responded for tonight, let's see if we can set something up for tomorrow (Tuesday) around 5:30 or later. Dinner can be involved. =) 🍕?
11-23 18:28 <Paula E> I have out of town guests so it may be tricky. I'll have to let you know tomorrow,
11-23 18:30 <Christy King> K
11-23 18:31 <Christy King> I can always do a little greening solo like I just did tonight, but it's more fun with other people, even if it's just a small crew. =) Let me know!
11-23 19:16 <Christy King> Fun!!
11-23 19:17 <Christy King> ###
11-23 20:00 <Zach Crawford> Beautiful!
11-23 20:13 <Christy King> That's Eriks in the center of the links, if you couldn't tell.
11-23 20:13 <Christy King> 😆
11-23 20:15 <Christy King> And SimpleSeeker / JennyAppleseed haven't taken anything down lately. Weird. I figure either they're on vacation, they died, or we broke 'em. ^_^;;
11-23 20:15 <Christy King> Probably the first one, but I prefer #3.
11-23 22:12 <Matt Corley> when I went through there last week, I noticed Enough didn't have AXA deploys everywhere
11-23 22:31 <Christy King> Enough attacked a few things tonight,.sort of. He gave up when they were recharged on.
11-23 22:31 <Christy King> Same with rwooten. Hmm...
11-23 22:31 <Christy King> #smurfsgiveup?
11-23 22:54 <Matt Corley> Maybe! so speaking of AXA, Santa Cruz res made an 8 farm last night at Cabrillo College with 70 AXA.
11-23 22:54 <Matt Corley> we nuked it all
11-23 22:54 <Matt Corley> =D
11-23 23:05 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
11-24 00:22:57 *** fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck added user 'Eric Sphoo' to conversation
11-24 00:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok, sphoo is added to this hangout now
11-24 06:52 <Christy King> Hi Sphoo! Welcome! I'm agent Seakay.
11-24 06:52 <Christy King> Matt, that's awesome and hilarious! How much ap??
11-24 09:12 <Justin Kominar> Seeker was active this morning.
11-24 09:13 <Justin Kominar> He pinged the fire station near Netflix ... likely on his way into work.
11-24 09:13 <Maria la Gorda> Got pinged by Jenny
11-24 09:13 <Maria la Gorda> just now
11-24 09:13 <Justin Kominar> Didn't take it down though, so probably a drive-by
11-24 11:41 <Christy King> Weird, right?
11-24 11:43 <Christy King> Well then, either broken or maybe trying to deny us all ap? But his teammates are definitely not on that game plan. All sorts of juicy fields to take down last night.
11-24 11:44 <Christy King> In any case, I'm not complaining!!
11-24 12:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just woke up, it's so beautiful and rainy out today
11-24 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Love it
11-24 12:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And last night I found the other half of Sockstravaganza! Ie the rest of my kneesocks
11-24 12:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wahoo
11-24 12:26 <Christy King> Nice! I love waking up to the sound of rain. Even working with the sound of rain is pretty nice. =)
11-24 12:28 <Maria la Gorda> Hot coco :-)
11-24 12:28 <Christy King> I'm having some right now!
11-24 12:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omg no way
11-24 12:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was just thinking how good some cocoa would be right now
11-24 13:08 <Christy King> It is delicious. ☕
11-24 13:08 <Christy King> =D
11-24 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Man I hate to say it but I gotta take a little break from ingress
11-24 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like
11-24 13:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 18, maybe 24 full hours
11-24 13:49 <Maria la Gorda> I hear you. I take breaks too
11-24 13:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Work and sleep I need to catch up on both
11-24 13:49 <Maria la Gorda> Self care :-)
11-24 13:50 <Christy King> Whaaaaat? Ingress = Life.
11-24 13:50 <Christy King> Just kidding.
11-24 13:50 <Christy King> Some days are a 1 hack kind of day. =)
11-24 13:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah and I kinda fell asleep before my shift even was over last night
11-24 13:50 <Maria la Gorda> No you aren't :-P
11-24 13:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Slept 12 hours too
11-24 13:50 <Maria la Gorda> My previous comment was for Christy
11-24 13:51 <Christy King> Haha
11-24 13:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol maria yeah, got that hehehe
11-24 13:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am gonna start work early today to catch up
11-24 13:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But
11-24 13:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Today is the last day I work til Monday
11-24 13:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I will go outside and hack art deco wall at least
11-24 14:12 <Christy King> Oh man, I still have tomorrow at work.
11-24 14:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I might have to dial in for staff meeting in the am
11-24 14:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone else gonna be free during these next 7 days much?
11-24 14:20 <Justin Kominar> I may have some time... the fam really hasn't sorted out what we're doing over the holiday break.
11-24 14:21 <Justin Kominar> Likely still evenings though.. not much day-time.
11-24 16:28 <Eric Sphoo> Hi everyone!

11-25 00:23 <Paula E> This is the other of the dynamic duo of the downtown Saratoga agents (ulua) he been playing since the beginning and had decided to come out retirement and help us keep the area green. Welcome back!!
11-25 00:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> hey everyone! glad to be back  ☺
11-25 00:25 <Paula E> So glad to have you!!!
11-25 00:26 <Paula E> In this HO they often will announce gatherings etc in LG and now that you two are back we are planning on linking a lot of the neighboring cities 
11-25 00:28 <Maria la Gorda> Welcome!
11-25 02:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I wanna see saratoga campbell and lg all in green fields
11-25 02:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Contiguous green fields
11-25 02:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wahoo! Done work now til Monday morning ÷
11-25 07:07 <Christy King> Welcome Periplum and Ulula! I'm agent Seakay. =)
11-25 09:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok starting my million ap day if I can do it!

11-25 09:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And then field field field
11-25 09:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Field like there's no tomorrow!
11-25 09:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm gonna see if I can get a million ap today. Have several charged up battery packs
11-25 09:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Clothes for warm and cold and a Nalgene container FULL of coffee
11-25 09:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wait, half full
11-25 09:26 <Justin Kominar> kick ass!
11-25 10:29 <Eric Sphoo> Woop woop! 
11-25 10:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ulula I see you're nearby, whatchoo up to?
11-25 10:52 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ulula and I planning to go to LG for lunch. Anything you need us to around North Santa Cruz avenue?
11-25 10:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No but paula is en route to pick me up and I'm pretty sure we're heading to lg first
11-25 10:53 <Christy King> If any of you swing through the park, I can drop some keys for within the park and along LG Blvd. =)
11-25 10:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am on an unholy mission to get ap, do feel free to drop keys, cannot guarantee I will get to them or get to them in time
11-25 10:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Finding keys on the ground is the same feeling as when I find a dollar on the ground :-)
11-25 10:56 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We will need to be back at the office shortly after the lunch so we won't have time to go to the park today. But we will blow what we see around.
11-25 10:59 <Christy King> I have loooots of keys, but rather than make a pile and maybe attract the Seekers (they've stolen keys from me before!), ping me if you're coming through and I'll drop a capsule.
11-25 10:59 <Christy King> I'm at the back end, near YSI portals
11-25 11:10 <Christy King> If you come in the Nature Center, don't mention Ingress. Just say you know me, and I'll come out to say hi, and can step outside to "show you the nature trail". =)
11-25 11:26 <Christy King> Psst! Swing by Eriks and drop 8s on it. It's almost a L8 portal!!
11-25 11:26 <Christy King> Also, Eriks or nearby JJ Magoos are good places for lunch. =)
11-25 11:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Change of plans here. We won't make it LG today. Sorry. But I will drop L8s when there next time
11-25 11:36 <Christy King> Bummer! But hooray for next time. =)
11-25 11:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah we are portaling our way there so
11-25 11:38 <Christy King> Bluefish, you and Paula can still bring Eriks to L8. Can you swing by?
11-25 11:38 <Christy King> We link to that a ton, so it would be awesome.
11-25 11:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy we are just about there
11-25 11:54 <Christy King> Park or Eriks?
11-25 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Park
11-25 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But not quite there
11-25 11:57 <Christy King> I'll work on a capsule
11-25 12:04 <Christy King> 66 keys ready. Just say when. =)
11-25 12:08 <Christy King> If you have any low level gear you want to get rid of, feel free to drop it for my tadpole. No worries if it's all recycled though! I can take extra empty capsules, too, if you have an overabundance. I fill them for tadpoles. Do you need anything besides keys?
11-25 12:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We are here
11-25 12:13 <Christy King> Dropped near the YSI Turtle
11-25 12:14 <Christy King> 🐢
11-25 12:14 <Christy King> On the edge away from the fields.
11-25 12:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can you also drop a single key
11-25 12:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> To anything
11-25 12:16 <Christy King> Done
11-25 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Got it, thanks!
11-25 12:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wanna come out and say hi or anything
11-25 12:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It just got nice out
11-25 12:17 <Christy King> Sure!
11-25 13:05 <Christy King> Looks like you've got a tail...
11-25 13:05 <Christy King> ###
11-25 13:05 <Justin Kominar> Must be nice to not have a job...
11-25 13:12 <Christy King> No kidding!
11-25 13:12 <Christy King> Anyone free to hit Legacy & Jcc??
11-25 13:28 <Christy King> Whoever is helping charge the dam, THANK YOU!!!!!
11-25 14:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am charging everything on the trail I have keys to between campbell park and oka land
11-25 14:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Page dam included
11-25 18:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> any of you play in Saratoga, often?
11-25 18:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I mostly play in Saratoga, but I am in LG often
11-25 18:29 <Christy King> I drive through Saratoga sometimes and do what I can along the way. Mostly LG though.
11-25 18:29 <Christy King> I think Justin works in Saratoga
11-25 18:33 <Paula E> I play in Saratoga 
11-25 18:38 <Christy King> Paula is Queen of Saratoga. =)
11-25 19:26 <Maria la Gorda> Woohoo!!
11-25 19:50 <Justin Kominar> I work in Mountain View (although rumor has it we're moving to the Sunnyvale office buildings sometime in Dec)
11-25 19:58 <Justin Kominar> When I move, I will likely go through Saratoga daily to get into Sunnyvale, rather than take 85 into Mountain View as I do now... so I'll be through Saratoga much more frequently in the future ... the trade off is I'll be down in Seeker-ville a little less as a result.
11-25 21:48 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Justin, that's cool. I think there are some nice fielding opportunities between Saratoga and LG. 
11-25 22:29 <Paula E> "Think " there are a ton ofFielding opportunities 
11-25 23:11 <Christy King> I would very much like to see those fields happen. 😊
11-25 23:14 <Paula E> They have been ill post pics
11-26 06:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyone happen to be awake, without plans and wanna go do a specific fielding op with me?
11-26 06:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's just more than I can do by myself on a bike, I'd spend hours just getting keys
11-26 06:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I need to stop looking at Intel map I guess
11-26 06:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I got so excited
11-26 06:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Le sigh
11-26 13:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well
11-26 13:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> After last night it's very clear to me ###### is not done escalating
11-26 13:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Followed me all around on my bike last night,  like really close, and when I swerve to get out of the way and pulled ovet, he just pulled up behind me and parked behind me
11-26 13:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He's not going to stop and I'm just gonna call 911 next time. I've got his plate numbers from last night's round of terror
11-26 13:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wonder how he would feel if I did what he is doing to me to his wife or kids
11-26 13:33 <Maria la Gorda> Wow!
11-26 13:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Somehow I'd be a monster
11-26 13:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He nearly knocked me off my bike last night
11-26 13:34 <Maria la Gorda> I'd call the cops too
11-26 13:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-26 13:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm going to play some ingress now, betcha I get harassed again
11-26 13:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Betcha
11-26 13:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It being a holiday won't stop him
11-26 13:44 <Maria la Gorda> Have fun! M stuffed & have to drive my dad to Monterey 
11-26 13:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm going to also start taking pics of him and his car each time this happens
11-26 13:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Got a pic last night but my hands were shaking kinda bad and didn't get it in focus
11-26 13:47 <Maria la Gorda> When Travis came after me in Willow Glenn, I had the video recorder ready to record if he did anything. Luckily, he did not nothing.
11-26 13:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I should get the same readied up
11-26 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This dude is fucking psycho
11-26 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause its that or
11-26 13:48 <Maria la Gorda> & I was in constant communication with another enl agent. My heart was racing... But safety first
11-26 13:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm having amazing hallucinations involving only him
11-26 13:49 <Maria la Gorda> Don't let him take over your peace
11-26 13:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh I need to stop talking about this now as josh is here
11-26 13:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I don't want to bother him
11-26 13:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry josh
11-26 15:51 <Justin Kominar> Vasona is green again
11-26 16:31 <Christy King> Eek. That's crazy bluefish. He was semi following me last night after work, but a few portals behind. Then he suddenly left and was on the scanner elsewhere... I guess that's why. What a creep.
11-26 16:32 <Christy King> Justin, NICE WORK!! Vasona looks great!
11-26 16:32 <Christy King> Happy Thanksgiving all!!
11-26 16:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You too,  happy Thanksgiving!
11-26 17:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I made some nice fields
11-26 17:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maria my peace is long gone. Ignoring him only means he tries to run me off the road now.  Have to always be looking over my shoulder etc
11-26 17:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug, I'm trying to not let it sour my whole life,  and it's not
11-26 17:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've been through worse
11-26 17:29 <Maria la Gorda> That's a great attitude 💪😊
11-26 17:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess only request is this: if any of you think I'm making any of this up or "just crazy", which I understand is the viewpoint of a lot of people,  I'd appreciate if you could keep it to yourself is all. This is hard on me and having people tell me I'm crazy not only makes it even harder, but also means I could be a lifetime movie network movie :-)
11-26 17:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I will do my best to not have it rule every conversation I have :-)
11-26 17:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And now it's time to bike around some more and play more ingress
11-26 17:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nowhere near my million ap a day goal for the day
11-26 17:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hit it yesterday though
11-26 17:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 1.1 million ap
11-26 17:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wanna get to level 14 asap, 13 is an unlucky number!
11-26 18:08 <Christy King> Simple follows others too. You and Josh (Krellan) should chat. He got followed a few times.
11-26 19:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah but this is following someone against a court order. Not to diminish their experiences,  cause getting followed sucks esp if you're without a car
11-26 19:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I've been followed by other players, just not in any creepy or even spiteful manner
11-26 19:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Man its cold outside.  My feet have been transformed into foot shaped blocks of ice
11-26 19:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If I go out again tonight,  I'll need warmer socks for sure
11-26 19:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh I made 5594 in mu today!
11-26 19:55 <Justin Kominar> It was cold on vasona today even when the sun was up.  Supposed to go just below freeing tonight, so definitely bundle up!
11-26 19:55 <Justin Kominar> We are on a cold spell for the next 2 days I believe...
11-26 19:56 <Maria la Gorda> BOO I should go to black friday & get those gloves to play
11-26 20:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Holy moly
11-26 20:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula is an amazing cook, she brought me the most wonderful plates of thanksgiving dinner items
11-26 21:25 <Maria la Gorda> seeker is in my hood. just got pinged
11-26 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks for the info
11-26 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Think paula and I are gonna take a drive tonight for some fields
11-26 21:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I see jackass roostermorgan hit art deco wall while I was having turkey dinner and recovering from that
11-26 21:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah he's across the street now
11-26 21:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If he bumps art deco to 7, they put an axa on it, just gonna jarvis it
11-26 21:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah he only hit this neighborhood like 10 min ago
11-26 21:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Probably the first thing he came for lol
11-26 21:52 <Justin Kominar> There's a bunch of decent sized fields down in my next of the woods and over to Saratoga to be made... 2 sides are up.. just gotta close them up!
11-26 22:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah that's our plan :)
11-26 22:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thats,the stuff I got all super excited about last night
11-26 22:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna go smash up hen at dairy queen while I wait
11-26 22:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Those ginormous thick green fields along the coast are amazing!
11-27 11:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it looks beautiful
11-27 12:15 <Lance Fanger> Nice job Shpoo
11-27 12:26 <Justin Kominar> There are some EP8s downtown right now.. I dropped 8's on all the other ones on the way through.  Maybe we can get more of them up to 8 organically...
11-27 17:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll bike by in am hour or 3 to bump
11-27 17:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> First ans foremost I --must-- go smoosh Virginia park
11-27 17:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then grind some ap with deploys ans links in dtc
11-27 17:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then will head over to lg as I will be needing more gear at that point
11-27 17:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo, a plan is born
11-27 17:59 <Paula E> FYI Saratoga is having their tree lighting ceremony tonight started at 5:00 merchants and restaurants are in the holiday spirit. While you and your family are having fun pls upgrade the portals.
11-27 22:31 <Maria la Gorda> ###
11-27 22:46 <Christy King> Wooooh!! Congrats!
11-27 22:46 <Maria la Gorda> Thank you!
11-27 22:58 <Paula E> Woo hoo
11-27 22:58 <Maria la Gorda> Thank you!!
11-28 01:26 <Justin Kominar> Just filled in a bunch of gaps :)
11-28 01:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Godamnit
11-28 01:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm oncall, I forgot.  And my useless coworker started war dialing me within 5 min of my oncall starting
11-28 01:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Booooo
11-28 01:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Soon hulk smash
11-28 07:36 <Eric Sphoo> Heh 
11-28 10:08 <Justin Kominar> I suspect seeker is in a self imposed AP denial mode until the 1st, at which point being totally full up on gear,  he'll go on a massive smash spree too.  It's dubious of him to let the area be so green right now...  Especially with so many high value anchors to drop.
11-28 11:06 <Christy King> Yeah, except he tore through LG on Wed night. I guess he made an exception?
11-28 11:08 <Christy King> That's been the only time I've seen him deploy. Jenny and the kids had a few fields, but I don't think he made any.
11-28 11:09 <Christy King> Or maybe other smurfs made the links off Seeker family portals. But I'm pretty sure they were the ones to field off The Watcher and jcc.
11-28 15:14 <Brian Wiebe> Bluefish, if you need ap still, hit Legacy as there are 7 fields on it right now.
11-28 22:32 <Matt Corley> Christina and I are leaving dtla now. will blast through LG soon ^_^
11-29 00:27 <Christy King> Yay!!
11-29 00:31 <Matt Corley> I think the two of us ruined 20+ AXA
11-29 00:35 <Christy King> Awesome!!! SimpleEnough's?
11-29 00:36 <Matt Corley> Yeah his and seekers
11-29 00:36 <Christy King> The Simple Twins.
11-29 00:36 <Matt Corley> there were 8 alone at The Cats  / Oakwood bar bar along 17
11-29 00:36 <Christy King> Simpletons
11-29 00:37 <Matt Corley> ah  and out comes seeker right now
11-29 00:38 <Christy King> When Brian attacked the one at Bear Creek, it had a couple of AXAs and then InKleinNation was there in less than 2 minutes to rechaege, redeploy, and drop more AXAs... so Brian ADA'd it!
11-29 00:38 <Brian Wiebe> No jarvised it*
11-29 00:39 <Christy King> Yep sorry, jarvised it.
11-29 00:40 <Christy King> Is Seeker retaking LG or attacking Santa Cruz?
11-29 00:42 <Matt Corley> no he's at legacy
11-29 10:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I tried to go out last night to play
11-29 10:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can't do it
11-29 10:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too cold
11-29 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And thanks to the gross incompetence of a coworker I will be working again all day today
11-29 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sigh
11-29 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No double ap for this fish
11-29 12:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No level 14 either
11-29 13:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I've seen today Travel247 in process of blowing up downtown Saratoga. I've fixed some portals she've blown but not all.
11-29 13:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Does anybody know how to get to this portal? I could not get to it from the public road ###
11-29 13:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> maybe my GPS was off a bit
11-29 13:13 <Maria la Gorda> Maybe it's in a gated community
11-29 13:14 <Maria la Gorda> There are portals in San Jose that are located in gated communities... Unfortunately
11-29 13:43 <Christy King> Is Montalvo Road a private road? :/
11-29 13:43 <Maria la Gorda> Not to my memory
11-29 13:43 <Justin Kominar> Don't believe so.
11-29 13:43 <Justin Kominar> No gates or signs or anything that I can recall.
11-29 13:44 <Christy King> It looked like the portal might be reachable from Montalvo... but also, intel on my phone is crappy so I could be wrong.
11-29 13:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Motalvo rd. is public road but I could not reach the portal from it because it seems to be located at somebody's estate, behind the gate
11-29 14:20 <Brian Wiebe> Is Niantic reviewing edits still or do those get filed with the new portal submissions that have been archived to Oblivion?
11-29 14:21 <Matt Corley> i have no idea. i'll ask Hanke when I do goruck  :D
11-29 14:31 <Maria la Gorda> I report the portal since it's sitting on private property and only that person can access it
11-29 14:34 <Maria la Gorda> *I'd
11-29 14:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok I think I can finish work within an hour or two
11-29 14:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then I HAVE to hit level 14
11-29 14:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cold or not cold
11-29 14:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There is only do or do not. There is no try!
11-29 14:52 <Christy King> Jumping Jacks will warm you up between hacks!
11-29 14:52 <Christy King> Goooooooo, Bluefish!!
11-29 14:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Also I got some better gloves
11-29 14:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And a pen with a special tip that works on touch screens
11-29 14:53 <Christy King> Smart. I need to start bringing gloves. My fingers were ready to fall off last night!
11-29 14:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have fingerless gloves which weren't enough yesterday and ski gloves which doesn't allow me to hold the pen well
11-29 14:54 <Christy King> K got some touch screen gloves at the DeAnza flea market last year (only a couple bucks!). Time to dig those out!
11-29 14:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have those from when they first started making them
11-29 14:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> They're super annoying and the pen is easier for me
11-29 14:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I must qualify that
11-29 14:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have giant man hands
11-29 14:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not dainty girl hands
11-29 14:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Family curse
11-29 15:38 <Christy King> Hahaha
11-29 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Work killing me aieeeee
11-30 00:36 <Eric Sphoo> I just smashed what was left of blue DTLG. Heh. Let's keep up the melee! Whoooo 
11-30 00:55 <Paula E> Krokodil are you referring to the fountain or the griffin portal? Both are reachable from the street which is public access. The fountain portal is a bit tricky and at times you may have to wait for the drift.
11-30 02:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Eric, I saw, good work!
11-30 02:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I so can't sleep
11-30 02:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Boo
11-30 05:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wow and I definitely can't play a broken game in this cold
11-30 05:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 10 min in one spot can't get a single burster to fire
11-30 05:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn
11-30 05:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah, unplayable
11-30 06:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
11-30 06:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was easily the most miserable time I've had trying to play this game
11-30 06:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Came home in tears with unbeatable pain from cold
11-30 06:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Fuck this
11-30 06:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna have to uber to work today
11-30 06:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Don't recall it ever getting this cold here
11-30 07:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wish you didn't need a car to play
11-30 07:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But you do, unless you want to freeze and only ever build little things
11-30 07:25 <Christy King> It has been record setting cold lately, so it definitely doesn't usually get this cold.
11-30 07:27 <Christy King> ❄❄❄❄❄
11-30 07:31 <Maria la Gorda> Was ingressing in Martinez at night & running from portals to portals to keep warm didnt not help at all
11-30 07:33 <Maria la Gorda> I was bikegressing last friday in dtsj, & I was an ice cube. 
11-30 08:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sorry to whine so much about it, let me ask
11-30 08:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Does it always get this cold here?
11-30 08:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I lived here in the 90s and just don't remember it ever being cold enough to snow
11-30 08:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh christy already answered
11-30 08:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
11-30 08:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Last night was definitely cold enough to s
11-30 08:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Snow
11-30 08:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I took a super long hot shower this am, that helped
11-30 08:17 <Maria la Gorda> I remember it was freezing when I was younger, but the weather has warmed up over the years. This is the coldest I've felt in years
11-30 08:18 <Maria la Gorda> I don't know how I
11-30 08:19 <Maria la Gorda> I don't know how I'll ingress in DC as their daytime temperature is our night time temperature here. I'm imagining that night time temperature falls below 30 degrees F... 
11-30 10:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Regularly yes
11-30 10:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Have to stop hacking due to the rain. My phone screen is cracked and is not waterproof anymore  :(
11-30 10:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> By the way, anybody knows a place nearby to replace a glass on Galaxy S6?
11-30 11:46 <Christy King> Ooh, ouch. I dont. Verizon store maybe or one of the malls?  =(
11-30 11:47 <Christy King> Maria, you'll want to invest in some nice coats, since it will be cold enough, often enough, you'll get good use out of them. That will help a lot. And carry a cup of coffee or warm tea at all times. ☕🍵☕
11-30 11:48 <Maria la Gorda> Gonna wait til m in DC to buy clothes...clothes here are too thin
11-30 11:49 <Christy King> Barbara, yeah, this is highly unusual. There was one time ever when I was a kid that it snowed even down to the beaches in Santa Cruz. Usually, it's still in the 60s in the winter. And starting next month, potential for lots and lots of rain. And flooding. 😯
11-30 12:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can't wait til the roads get icy, that will be fun
11-30 12:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> NOT
11-30 12:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Looks like I will hit level 14 today
11-30 12:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll just be happy with that
11-30 12:32 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Wut
11-30 12:45 <Maria la Gorda> Woot!!
11-30 13:05 <Lance Fanger> Hit 14 on my way to work today now 15 looks hard.
11-30 13:14 <Justin Kominar> Wait until the 16-grind  :(
11-30 13:14 <Justin Kominar> I'm still 12 mil away...
11-30 13:28 <Christy King> Wooh, 2 people hitting 14 today, that's awesome!!
11-30 13:29 <Maria la Gorda> Woot!!
11-30 13:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lance! Grats!

11-30 14:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> /me stares at the clock and tries to make it go quicker
11-30 15:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yesssssss
11-30 15:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Boss let me go early so I could level!
11-30 15:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Waiting on an uber to bring my butt home now
11-30 15:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's nice enough to bike too! Woo hoo!
11-30 15:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> /me does a little dance
11-30 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anybody want me to come work on some area? Taking requests! Open offer also if anyone wants to buddy up today
11-30 15:19 <Christy King> Your boss let you go early FOR INGRESS?!?  ...Whoa.
11-30 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> She totally did yes
11-30 15:20 <Christy King> Seeker went through the park earlier. It was right before I came back from lunch, so I reclaimed most of it on my way in =) but not all.
11-30 15:21 <Christy King> LG Blvd would be good. I can make a ton of links to Eriks from here if it turns green. =D
11-30 15:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Eriks ok
11-30 15:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy
11-30 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What's the best approach for getting to eriks, winchester or bascom
11-30 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm home and quick bowl and clothing change and heading out shortly
11-30 15:43 <Christy King> I think Bascom turns into LG Blvd.
11-30 15:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If I take the trail I'll never make it
11-30 15:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wanna bike down on roads then trail back up
11-30 15:44 <Christy King> But if you go down Winchester and across Lark, there are some wonderful portals you can hit along the way...
11-30 15:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh
11-30 15:44 <Christy King> So that's my vote
11-30 15:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How very right you are
11-30 15:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll do that yeah
11-30 15:45 <Christy King> ###
11-30 15:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I would love to hit level 14 blowing up lark!
11-30 15:45 <Christy King> It is just BEGGING for a visit...
11-30 15:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah
11-30 15:45 <Christy King> That's level worthy
11-30 15:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I love smashing fields
11-30 15:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks!
11-30 15:59 <Christy King> Help!! We're stuck under a blue field of nastiness!!
11-30 15:59 <Christy King> ###
11-30 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah
11-30 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What's the anchor on that
11-30 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was maybe gonna go fuck up Ken and gloria levy first and foremost
11-30 16:03 <Christy King> Can't tell. Intel is crap on my phone.
11-30 16:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Totally stealth
11-30 16:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It will become apparent no worries
11-30 16:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I will LOVE smooshing these, taking off now
11-30 16:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna key farm my way down winchester
11-30 16:05 <Christy King> Ooh wait... it's IN the park! At the far end....
11-30 16:05 <Christy King> ###
11-30 16:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh to really be off his radar I could key farm my way down the trail
11-30 16:05 <Christy King> Aha it's in Oak Meadow.
11-30 16:06 <Christy King> And the smaller one is at the Red Bridge.
11-30 16:06 <Christy King> ###
11-30 16:07 <Christy King> And other anchors are a) one of the Legacy portals and b) The Watcher (where Lark hits LG Blvd). Boom.
11-30 16:11 <Christy King> Huh. Seeker is hitting the front of the park AGAIN today. Just a few hours after the last time. Does he have the day off??
11-30 16:12 <Christy King> Or maybe he lost his job. Yelled at customers for tresspassing or something. =D
11-30 16:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###
11-30 16:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ans I'm just about to finish smashing and capping legacy church
11-30 16:51 <Christy King> Awww yeeeeah!!!
11-30 16:51 <Christy King> I just saw a field go down!
11-30 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###
11-30 16:52 <Christy King> Go Bluefish! Go Bluefish!
11-30 16:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> First reso deployed in legacy church did it
11-30 16:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###
11-30 16:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> ###
11-30 17:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Think he's down at vasona, gonna go kill one of his anchors to the trail
11-30 17:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Post office
11-30 17:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And quite possibly everything in between
11-30 17:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That other field is down now too
11-30 17:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oka lane then eriks
11-30 17:28 <Christy King> Yay! There's one left at the dam, but that's on my way home so I can take that one.
11-30 21:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm gonna go check out downtown campbell or ccc for more ap
11-30 21:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> As usual, team simpletons followed me all around wrecking what I made
11-30 21:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Boo hoo etc
11-30 21:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But so I'm thinking
11-30 21:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe I can get them to help me rack up captures and capture ap by heading to ccc
11-30 22:06 <Maria la Gorda> Is dtlg blue?
12-01 11:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh so last night I got followed by 2 cars, one with seeker and one with baywolfbayyyyy
12-01 11:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Trying to wreck what I did in green and doing the same fields in blue
12-01 11:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess imitation is a form of flattery
12-01 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or of people who are too pathetic to make up their own stuff to do
12-01 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> One of those
12-01 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Should I go wait outside their place and when they start fielding just follow them around
12-01 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-01 11:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I feel like I should start offering a service though
12-01 11:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like, want seekers to leave you alone for an op? Hire me, I'll just go play as normal and your problems will be solved! :)
12-01 11:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like, I feel like there's got to be a way we can use this to our advantage
12-01 11:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Those guys got me so much more ap last night than I was even expecting
12-01 11:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> More than a million ap after I left work
12-01 11:17 <Justin Kominar> That's awesome.
12-01 11:17 <Justin Kominar> I got a decent amount out of the 2x period, but not as much as I was hoping.  Wanted to get to 30 mil, but fell short.
12-01 11:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dude its still going on
12-01 11:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Til tonight at midnight
12-01 11:18 <Justin Kominar> oh I know, but I'm not going to have time to capitalize on it much more.
12-01 11:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There's still time!
12-01 11:18 <Justin Kominar> Life ... unfortunately  :(
12-01 11:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh yeah I hear ya
12-01 11:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I burnt myself out a little on my ap push
12-01 11:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So am not planning on balls to the wall nonstop ap til midnight
12-01 11:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I got 2 levels this hacksmas,  I'm totally pleased with this
12-01 11:37 <Justin Kominar> That's pretty awesome.
12-01 11:37 <Justin Kominar> It's been a long grind to 16 for me so far... several months off at my current pace still
12-01 12:21 <Maria la Gorda> Smurfs like to follow us frogs & smash our work
12-01 12:44 <Josh Lehan> Nice, i hit legacy on the way home yesterday 
12-01 12:44 <Josh Lehan> I will put hack mods on Vasona today, finally a lighter day at work, it has been some time 
12-01 12:47 <Justin Kominar> Looks like The Watcher needs to be dropped.
12-01 12:48 <Christy King> ☝  Big time.
12-01 12:51 <Josh Lehan> Where is the watcher? 
12-01 12:52 <Christy King> Gas station at Lark and LG Blvd
12-01 12:59 <Justin Kominar> ^ that
12-01 12:59 <Justin Kominar> Since it's on a busy corner, you really need to pull into the gas station to have a good chance at killing it.
12-01 13:02 <Josh Lehan> Near the Rotten Robbie? 
12-01 13:02 <Justin Kominar> Further up
12-01 13:03 <Justin Kominar> By the Panera bread, office supply store, car wash
12-01 13:03 <Josh Lehan> You are in luck. Found a cache of VRHS and VRMH in a forgotten capsule. So you get the good stuff. Can not keep them for the anomaly, anyway. 
12-01 13:03 <Josh Lehan> Got it 
12-01 13:06 <Justin Kominar> You'll best know it from the copious blue fields that are anchored off of it right now as you approach  ☺
12-01 13:06 <Justin Kominar> I'll take it down on my way home tonight if someone doesn't beat me to it.
12-01 13:31 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-01 13:31 <Josh Lehan> Geese marched right in front of me 
12-01 13:32 <Justin Kominar> Did you honk at them?
12-01 13:48 <Josh Lehan> HONK 
12-01 14:09 <Josh Lehan> Wow, did a complete tour of the interior of the park, in 90 minutes, working on optimizing the route 
12-01 14:10 <Christy King> That's awesome! And I am *LOVING* these hack mods!! 😆
12-01 14:21 <Josh Lehan> Yay great 
12-01 15:05 <Christy King> Hmm, I don't think Seeker is a big fan of Zach and I linking back and forth across LG Blvd, haha. There is yet another blocker up. Hahaha
12-01 16:20 <Josh Lehan> I thought about throwing a field from Discover Water back to nature trail but did not want to block outgoing radius from Erik's 
12-01 16:32 <Christy King> It's already blocked. Can you tell where the ends are?
12-01 16:35 <Christy King> It looks like one end is Trader Joes. Anyone need to do a little shopping? ...for AP? =)
12-01 16:35 <Christy King> ###
12-01 16:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> That blocker is first baptist to Trader Joe's
12-01 16:36 <Justin Kominar> I left the house late this morning and the school rush was on, so I couldn't stop to reclaim my fielded up home portal  :(
12-01 16:36 <Justin Kominar> That blocker will be gone in about an hour and a bit when I get home.
12-01 16:36 <Christy King> Oh cool, I couldn't see the other end from here. Thanks!
12-01 16:36 <Christy King> Yesssss
12-01 16:37 <Justin Kominar> They ALWAYS come cap my home portal, but they were very very ballsy to actually field it up for the first time, last night.
12-01 16:37 <Justin Kominar> Generally seeker just leaves it neutral, or with one R1 on it
12-01 16:37 <Christy King> I'm in the park until 5ish, so I can throw some links out if the blocker is gone before I head out.
12-01 16:37 <Justin Kominar> Their gambit paid off, because I wasn't expecting fields, and just couldn't stop anywhere to pop it with all the school drop-off cars taking up all the street parking at the time.
12-01 16:38 <Christy King> Ooh, that is ballsy!
12-01 16:38 <Justin Kominar> Is the watcher still up?
12-01 16:39 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it's green
12-01 16:39 <Justin Kominar> ok ... good to know.  so I don't have to swing by there.  I'll just head straight home.
12-01 17:14 <Josh Lehan> I will check trader joe's on LGB if needed on my way home 
12-01 17:18 <Christy King> I'm about to head out
12-01 17:19 <Christy King> I can hit TJs. Need to get some food anyways.
12-01 17:36 <Christy King> Liza can you hit goodwill?
12-01 17:48 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it's already green
12-01 18:00 <Christy King> Yeah, I swung over there just in case. And so did Justin. You and one more person will make it L7
12-01 18:07 <Josh Lehan> Cool 
12-01 18:09 <Christy King> Bwahahaha!  Whoever turned Legacy green, I'm having fun with that!!!
12-01 18:09 <Christy King> ###
12-01 18:09 <Christy King> ###
12-01 18:10 <Josh Lehan> Nice field! That corner will probably not last long 
12-01 18:12 <Christy King> No, no I'm sure it wont. ...Unless bluefish is out ingressing and he's too busy following her to notice!
12-01 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-01 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> See I think we could use this to our advantage I really do
12-01 18:46 <Christy King> There definitely needs to be an op with that method.
12-01 20:08 <Justin Kominar> Bluefish, just threw a link to the bike rack portal in Campbell.  If you still have a key to my church portal, may be able to make a decent field.
12-01 20:51 <Josh Lehan> Had an unpleasant encounter with SimpleStalker this evening 
12-01 20:53 <Josh Lehan> He started cussing at me and saying we cheat, and he has been stalking my info 
12-01 20:53 <Josh Lehan> Mentioned Eric (my partner) and that I was gay, no surprise there 
12-01 20:53 <Josh Lehan> And he mentioned "the Hangout" 
12-01 20:54 <Eric Sphoo> Millburry came and crashed a fracker party at CCC a second ago :( 
12-01 20:54 <Josh Lehan> He got all mad at me for hanging around "his" apartments when I was just going to JCC 
12-01 20:54 <Josh Lehan> And he was alone and yet 4 accounts rebuilt all portals nearby? Now who is cheating? 
12-01 20:55 <Eric Sphoo> Simplesucker is just mad because the self appointed "ingress mayor of Los Gatos" isn't holding his town down very well 
12-01 20:55 <Eric Sphoo> He came up here to Campbell yesterday to put a resistance beacon on town hall. 
12-01 20:55 <Eric Sphoo> So my buddy spizz2222 went and smashed DTLG early this morning 
12-01 20:55 <Josh Lehan> He must be mad because earlier today i OWNED Vasona park and the Roberts Road loop 
12-01 20:56 <Eric Sphoo> Also end of hacksmas so more activity 
12-01 20:56 <Josh Lehan> Great work clearing DTLG and LG Blvd area 
12-01 20:56 <Josh Lehan> Yes, double playfield ends midnight PST 
12-01 21:05 <Justin Kominar> He has a wife and 2 kids that play.  They legitimately have a family of 4 at his immediate disposal.
12-01 21:06 <Justin Kominar> For whatever it's worth, as annoying as he is, I don't think he cheats.
12-01 21:07 <Eric Sphoo> Aren't his kids under 13 which is a break of the TOS? 
12-01 21:07 <Justin Kominar> Well, yeah.  That's a bit of a grey area though, because even Niantic advertises the game as "family friendly" even though the TOS seems to contradict...
12-01 21:08 <Eric Sphoo> Hmm 
12-01 21:08 <Justin Kominar> My understanding though was that there's a Federal law that prevents data collection of minors... which is why they can't allow it.  You're either 18+ or an emancipated minor.  In which case, his (and MANY other) kids are in violation.
12-01 21:09 <Justin Kominar> So it's not just a Google/Niantic thing.  It's a USA thing.,
12-01 21:09 <Justin Kominar> There are MANY threads around online about kids playing the game.  The answers just aren't clear and Niantic doesn't seem to be in any kind of rush to put their foot down one way or another.
12-01 21:10 <Eric Sphoo> Aha 
12-01 21:10 <Matt Corley> the law is called COPPA - children's online privacy protection act
12-01 21:10 <Matt Corley> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act
12-01 21:10 <Justin Kominar> Yeah.. I remember challenging him in com about that one time he got all pissy with me... his response was that Google has educational accounts, so kids must be ok.
12-01 21:11 <Justin Kominar> But his kids aren't using google educational accounts, and even if they were, they are restricted in what they can do, and Ingress isn't among the white-listed apps.
12-01 21:11 <Matt Corley> if parent's give consent, its ok. so its not really a tos violation
12-01 21:12 <Justin Kominar> That's not clear from the TOS, actually.
12-01 21:12 <Justin Kominar> There no clause about consent.
12-01 21:12 <Matt Corley> that's what the law seems to requirte though
12-01 21:12 <Matt Corley> require
12-01 21:13 <Justin Kominar> "

12-01 21:14 <Justin Kominar> Even with parental consent, as I understand it ... of course, IANAL.
12-01 21:14 <Justin Kominar> And there's no wording in there that explicitly discusses parental/guardian's consent.
12-01 21:15 <Justin Kominar> And I *BELIEVE* it's not because Niantic gives a shit .. it's because they're tied to the Google accounts for auth, and there are specific terms tied to that from Google that they must adhere to.
12-01 21:15 <Josh Lehan> I got assigned to anomaly team, check Slack if you have not gotten your team yet 
12-01 21:15 <Josh Lehan> Wonder if Squeaker will be at anomaly? 
12-01 21:17 <Justin Kominar> I'm virtually positive the whole family will be there.
12-01 21:17 <Josh Lehan> Can't wait to make them use up all their gear 
12-01 21:19 <Justin Kominar> Yes, it will be nice to finally deploy all these AXA's that I haven't been using on them  :P
12-01 21:32 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-01 21:32 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-01 21:32 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-01 21:35 <Maria la Gorda> What a fucking creeper this guy
12-01 21:35 <Maria la Gorda> Is
12-01 21:35 <Maria la Gorda> Always accusing our agents doing what he does
12-01 21:43 <Christy King> I think Niantic changed the rules recently to ADD that under 13 are against TOS. Most likely because a parent complained or they were worried one might. Complained that people are talking to their child on comm (Seeker took someone to court over this, so he's probably the parent) and/or there's a concern that this could lead to the stalking of a minor. And Seeker is proof that in-game stalking happens.
12-01 21:45 <Christy King> You have a membership to jcc, Josh. You have a legit right to be there. He does *not* have a legit right to be in their parking lot. So he should shut his mouth.
12-01 21:48 <Christy King> By the way Josh, from what I can see you still own the park. Nicely done!!
12-01 22:01 <Justin Kominar> That clip of text I pasted above was pulled from Niantic's TOS on their website this evening.  No mention of explicitly forbidding minors.  But the "must be 13+" kinda did that to begin with, if you ask me...
12-01 22:05 <Christy King> Right. Apparently that wording was added a month or so ago. There was a lot of chatter about it in the HOs.
12-01 22:46 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-01 22:46 <Josh Lehan> He is clocking my time entering and leaving, now that is creepy 
12-01 22:47 <Josh Lehan> Although 2.5 hours makes sense: I Jarvised the same portal twice in one night! 
12-01 22:49 <unknown_105969224114245383430> uh, 2.5 hours isn't unreasonable. I've been at a gym longer than that before - an hour of it was showering and getting ready to go out ¯\(°_O)/¯ 
12-01 22:50 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If there is a pool and sauna, I spend a silly amount of time at my gym :)
12-01 22:50 <unknown_105969224114245383430> (I do also work out/take classes, not just lazing, lol)
12-01 22:52 <Josh Lehan> I went in and had good long workout then showered 
12-01 22:52 <Josh Lehan> Although part of the time was spent in a mad reso placing and shield placing and recharging frenzy 
12-01 22:53 <Josh Lehan> I had to leave otherwise would have tested a theory: did I really run him entirely out of bursters? He started hitting really weakly and then stopped entirely. Nice anomaly planning, if so! 
12-01 22:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ha! Nice He does sometimes get overworked up about things. So much for him retiring from Ingress, although I thought he liked the game a bit too much to leave entirely. :)
12-01 23:07 <Josh Lehan> He ranted about us trying to get him to "put down his scanner" and how he would not do it 
12-01 23:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-01 23:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh feel free to mention that following a player around who he has stated to a court of law he wants to leave him alone is also fucking creepy
12-01 23:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh
12-01 23:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry
12-01 23:23 <Christy King> How is working out creepy?
12-01 23:26 <Christy King> Now, hiding out in the parking lot at my work after its dark and the park has closed, that's creepy. Following you to the door of the gym and timing how long you're in there, creepy. Working out at your gym? Normal.
12-01 23:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He did that to you?!??
12-01 23:27 <Christy King> Since he already knows where you were and that you're a member, you should say that. "Waiting for me and timing how long I've been gone is creepy."
12-01 23:28 <Christy King> The gym one was Josh
12-01 23:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No I meant that first bit with the park
12-01 23:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The bit with timing how long you're at the gym for is also creepy and fucktard
12-01 23:29 <Christy King> But yeah, he walks through the park after dark sometimes lately. I've seen him lurking in the shadows of the parking lot. He doesn't approach me though. If he did, I'd call the cops and rangers.
12-01 23:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Jesus christ we should both carry pepper spray
12-01 23:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've been thinking about picking up a can of that stuff
12-01 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What a fucking fucktard
12-01 23:31 <Christy King> Sometimes he's walking out of the park still, which is fine aside from him being the one that yells about being in there after dark.
12-01 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah wtf
12-01 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I had no idea he was doing that
12-01 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm so sorry to hear it
12-01 23:32 <Christy King> He is SimpleStalker. What can you expect.
12-01 23:32 <Josh Lehan> What teams did everybody get assigned to, for anomaly? 
12-01 23:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well at least it's not just me he is so focused on being a creepy jackass with
12-01 23:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't realize how much he was messing with you or josh
12-01 23:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm sorry if anything I've said about all this has bothered you guys at all
12-01 23:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bigtime
12-01 23:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bigtime
12-01 23:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Timing you at the gym wtf
12-01 23:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Have any of you tried talking to jenny appleseed about any of this?
12-01 23:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Don't think she would be too receptive but was just wondering
12-01 23:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'd think after a certain amount of people approached her about this she might start to get the picture
12-02 07:16 <Christy King> Have not. I don't think I've ever seen Jenny on comm, either, so at least she's not chiming in and being an ass too.
12-02 11:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> In court she totally stood up for him, shrug
12-02 11:16 <Maria la Gorda> 
women in abusive relationships will usually stand up for their abusive husband
12-02 11:21 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I signed up for the free ticket for Anomaly, but does that also get you signed up to be put on a team?
12-02 11:22 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Travel had me distracted from gaming events :/
12-02 11:27 <Maria la Gorda> Did you at least get double AP
12-02 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maria good point
12-02 11:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm not saying he is hitting her but abuse can be more than physical
12-02 12:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I got some double AP but barely had time to play :(
12-02 12:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I got 2 more levels this hacksmas
12-02 12:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm 14 now
12-02 12:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Nice!  I'm still at 13.  slow but sure
12-02 12:41 <Christy King> Liza, you also have to sign up on the enl site
12-02 12:43 <Christy King> (Copying from a different HO:) Did you just sign up at the Niantic site?  If so you also need to sign up at http://enlightened.rocks/sf_bay to get put on an Enlightened team.
12-02 12:43 <Christy King> That link messed up
12-02 12:43 <Christy King> also need to sign up at http://enlightened.rocks/sf_bay to get put on an Enlightened team.
12-02 13:21 <Justin Kominar> Related to our discussion yesterday about youths in the game:  https://www.eff.org/press/releases/google-deceptively-tracks-students-internet-browsing-eff-says-complaint-federal-trade
12-02 13:58 <Paula E> I'd be careful of your accusations. You are entering dangerous territory.
12-02 14:04 <Justin Kominar> oh I'm not accusing ... I honestly don't care.  I think kids should be able to play too.
12-02 14:05 <Justin Kominar> I just tire of him bible-thumping the rules and trespassing and no cheating, etc. to me, when this is just as grey an area.
12-02 14:05 <Justin Kominar> Can't have it both ways...
12-02 14:07 <Paula E>   I'm referring to the abuse comments.
12-02 14:07 <Justin Kominar> Ah.
12-02 14:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I haven't made any accusations
12-02 14:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Huh
12-02 14:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Uh
12-02 14:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I guess this is no longer a safe space to talk about someone intentionally scaring the crap outta me
12-02 14:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I kinda thought it was
12-02 14:12 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's always okay to bring up actual experiences you have, but it's another thing to speculate as to his relations with his family and make assumptions.
12-02 14:13 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I think that is all that is being said. 
12-02 14:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I actually extended him benefit of the doubt
12-02 14:14 <Paula E> Thank you Liza that's what I'm trying to say.
12-02 14:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> We have the same rules at work.  Speak for yourself, but don't speak for others, let them tell their side.
12-02 14:15 <Paula E> And unless your talking to and paying therapist nothing is safe or kept private. Everyone talks, things slip or... Whatever 
12-02 14:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Trust no one, duly noted.
12-02 14:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks for at least letting me knos
12-02 14:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> don't even trust yourself  :D
12-02 14:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah wow
12-02 14:16 <Maria la Gorda> My fault. I was making a general statement not accusing
12-02 14:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm no longer comfortable making any comments
12-02 14:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I mean, I consider this a pretty safe space overall.  That's just me.
12-02 14:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Given that I just got told I cannot trust people in this chat,  by people in this chat
12-02 14:19 <unknown_105969224114245383430> She was just pointing out that no confidentiality statements are signed to be in this chat.  Also, I haven't met half the people in this chat.  They could be cats or bots or actual aliens for all I know.
12-02 14:20 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I like cats, and aliens could be neat.  So I'm still fine with all that.
12-02 14:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I like stickers
12-02 14:22 <Paula E> Lol you're funny Liza. What I stated is only my opinion, I've heard things from this HO from other people so I wonder. No biggie to me cuz I dont share very often or when I do it's nothing too private.
12-02 14:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And rainbows and unicorns
12-02 14:22 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
12-02 14:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I really love the Chrysler building in nyc too
12-02 14:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I can barely keep up with Ingress lately so I haven't heard anything much lol
12-02 14:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Once upon a time I lived in San José,  with an abusive fucktard, I was a nanny to his kids. He beat the shit out of me on a daily basis. I escaped at one point in sf, he basically drove around til he found me, choked me til I passed out, threw me into the back of the stolen delivery truck he was driving, drove me to the ocean and told me he was going to feed me to sharks. Please do pardon me if I get scared about people exhibiting stalker like qualities or get nervous when people follow me around. Especially at close distance when I'm just on bike.
12-02 14:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And that was one experience out of hundreds
12-02 14:33 <unknown_105969224114245383430>  I'm sorry that happened to you.  I've been stalked before, it's certainly no fun. I am cautious around others often, but I don't jump to conclusions when others act suspicious towards me, I remove myself from the situation.  Took a bit of therapy for that, though.
12-02 14:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza yeah and I don't think I've jumped to any conclusions
12-02 14:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I've only been followed twice in Ingress.  People are jerks for sure.  It happens, and that's why I usually play with others around.
12-02 14:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> But that can be tricky, and portals are everywhere.
12-02 14:35 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have been followed countless times in ingress, just part of the game really
12-02 14:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I used to walk around downtown and smurfs would sit behind me driving slow trying to retake portals
12-02 14:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have been followed on foot, in a car on a bike
12-02 14:36 <unknown_105969224114245383430> its just part of the game
12-02 14:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This following me bit has been ongoing for months and sure, maybe it's just a coincidence that the moment I go out to play he comes and hits every portal I hot. Probably just a coincidence that I almost got knocked off my bike by him in his car. How bout this, scroll back through comm logs and decide for yourself
12-02 14:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug
12-02 14:38 <Paula E> OK rewind I wasn't referring about stalking being followed or anything. My comment was simply referring to abuse I was saying be careful that is all. End of subject.
12-02 14:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> the resistance would not be active, I would leave the house, and a few of them would all of a sudden come out and follow me around, This happen for almost a year and still does
12-02 14:39 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I also agree with Paula and Liza
12-02 14:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am not comfortable saying much more
12-02 14:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> yeah, keep chatter to ingame play
12-02 14:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna go do my j-o-b then ingress once done that
12-02 14:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> talking about some dude abusing his wife makes things awkward and there is no real proof. That type of stuff isn't totally cool
12-02 14:41 <unknown_105969224114245383430> but liza and paula pretty much said it all
12-02 15:07 <Maria la Gorda> Had to stretch my hands out my front passenger window, at red light,  to deploy on right portal
12-02 15:07 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-02 16:01 <Christy King> Man, ap feels so slow now that it's back to regular! Haha
12-02 16:03 <Maria la Gorda> I'm so glad that it's just not me who feels the same LOL
12-02 16:05 <Christy King> Scrolling up, always good to be on the cautious side in a chat with more than 2-3 people. But for common courtesy, let's agree that no one should pass on info from here to smurfs, since this is enl only. =)
12-02 16:05 <Maria la Gorda> who's passing info to smurfs????
12-02 16:06 <Christy King> No moles! 🚫🐁 (closest image to a mole on here, haha)
12-02 16:06 <Christy King> No one
12-02 16:06 <Christy King> As far as I know
12-02 16:06 <Maria la Gorda> that's a cute mole
12-02 16:06 <Christy King> But people were talking about being cautious so I figured I'd throw that out there as a good plan to live by.
12-02 16:07 <Christy King> I know, right? Adorable!
12-02 16:08 <Christy King> ###
12-02 16:08 <Maria la Gorda> is that at your work?
12-02 16:09 <Christy King> Also not a mole, but a super adorable rodent nonetheless!
12-02 16:09 <Christy King> Yeah, that's one of our chinchillas.
12-02 16:09 <Maria la Gorda> that's what a chinchilla looks like
12-02 16:09 <Maria la Gorda> awww
12-02 16:09 <Maria la Gorda> it's so cute
12-02 16:10 <Christy King> Yeah, and SO SOFT!!!!!
12-02 16:10 <Maria la Gorda> cute ears
12-02 16:10 <Christy King> It has a squirrel like tail and mouse like ears, and the coat is like... thick velvet I guess.
12-02 16:11 <Christy King> One more, for the sake of cuteness...
12-02 16:11 <Christy King> ###
12-02 16:12 <Maria la Gorda> cute tail
12-02 16:13 <Maria la Gorda> what time do you close?
12-02 16:13 <Christy King> It's loosely ingress related, too. Come upgrade the portals here and you can meet this fluffy fellow! ^_^
12-02 16:13 <Christy King> 4:30
12-02 16:13 <Christy King> M-F
12-02 16:13 <Christy King> And open 1-2 on Saturdays
12-02 16:14 <Maria la Gorda> I won't be able to make it 😥😥😥
12-02 16:14 <Christy King> I'm here later than 430 but that's when we lock up
12-02 16:14 <Maria la Gorda> can I hold it?
12-02 16:14 <Christy King> No but I can take him out so you can pet him
12-02 16:14 <Justin Kominar> I hear they make great coats  ;)
12-02 16:14 <Maria la Gorda> OH NO JUSTIN!!!!
12-02 16:14 <Christy King> We have to keep the animals in our hands because of permits
12-02 16:15 <Christy King> Oh no you DIDN'T
12-02 16:15 <Maria la Gorda> I have an animal lover permit  ;)
12-02 16:16 <Christy King> I can see why they made coats. Soooo soft. But so tiny!! Now one species is extinct completely, one species is extinct in the wild, and the 3rd is very endangered.
12-02 16:16 <Christy King> >_<
12-02 16:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I miss my chinchilla.  I named him Chinzilla and he was awesome.
12-02 16:48 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-02 16:48 <Maria la Gorda> It arrived!!!!
12-02 16:48 <Eric Sphoo> ###
12-02 16:48 <Justin Kominar> Nice!
12-02 16:48 <Eric Sphoo> Woop woop! How exciting ! 
12-02 16:49 <Justin Kominar> ###
12-02 16:50 <Justin Kominar> Whoever posts their screenshot next has to have Onxy  ;)
12-02 16:56 <Eric Sphoo> This metal motivated me to haul ass from level 11 when double AP started 
12-02 17:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Eric what level medal did you get for that,  silver or gold?
12-02 17:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I would think at least silver
12-02 17:05 <Eric Sphoo> I got to mid 13 so got a gold 
12-02 17:05 <Eric Sphoo> I'm oodles ahead of my brother at the moment 
12-02 17:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh kickass! Good job!
12-02 17:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-02 17:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You are so cute with the sibling rivalry!
12-02 17:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh wait sorry,  that last comment had nothing to do with ingress, my bad
12-02 17:21 <Christy King> Haha
12-02 17:21 <Christy King> I *wish* I could post onyx.
12-02 17:22 <Christy King> I'm good with silver though!
12-02 17:24 <Matt Corley> OK here's a BLACK one ^_^
12-02 17:24 <Matt Corley> ###
12-02 17:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Silver is great, good job christy!
12-02 17:25 <Christy King> /drool
12-02 17:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Pretty sweet matt!
12-02 17:25 <Christy King> Congrats to everyone on the medals!!
12-02 17:26 <Matt Corley> thanks. I have black for all 3 years now ^_^
12-02 17:26 <Christy King> (Where's that done on smurf tears image?)
12-02 17:26 <Matt Corley> hmm, that could be a good g+ post
12-02 17:27 <Christy King> Daaaang. I just barely missed founder, got bronze innovator, and now silver. Slow progress but oh well!
12-02 17:27 <Christy King> Ahem, DINE on smurf tears.
12-02 17:27 <Christy King> Maria? You have that image? =D
12-02 17:45 <Maria la Gorda> Which image?
12-02 17:45 <Christy King> Josh (Krellan): OMG, the hack mods stayed up all day! SO AWESOME!! Thanks again!!
12-02 17:46 <Christy King> Maria: Dining on smurf tears B-)
12-02 17:47 <Maria la Gorda> I do but i'm not home
12-02 17:50 <Christy King> ###
12-02 17:51 <Christy King> Found it! ;)
12-02 18:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey ulula,  sorry I didn't stop in orchard kitchen to at least say hi, was taking my coworker out to lunch for his birthday
12-02 18:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He was kind enough to accompany me to the boulder creek portal to smash it up
12-02 18:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Would have liked to meet you
12-02 18:21 <Christy King> Recruit the coworker!
12-02 18:22 <Christy King> Hey, should we all get together for dinner one night soon? Mon, Tuea, or Fri nights are.usually good for me. What about you all?
12-02 18:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I already tried that, he says ingress is dumb. He's probably right but I'm not opposed to me liking dumb games
12-02 18:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I call it my dumb game to my boss
12-02 18:24 <Christy King> Darn
12-02 18:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> bluefish2317, ping me or periplum next time you are in downtown Saratoga. We usually there. We would love to meet to say hi or have coffee together
12-02 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'd like that
12-02 18:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Question and I'm sorry if this is rude,  are you two a guy and a girl,  2 girls, or 2 guys
12-02 18:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think ulula is maybe a guy but I kept referring to you as she to my coworker cause I don't know yall yet
12-02 18:43 <unknown_105969224114245383430> two guys. we are colleagues
12-02 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ah ok my bad in making assumptions there then, thanks so much for clarification!
12-02 18:44 <unknown_105969224114245383430> no problem  ☺
12-02 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omfg are you russian? !??
12-02 18:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I see you went to Kiev university
12-02 18:46 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ukrainians. not the same  ☺
12-02 18:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah not the same at all!
12-02 18:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have passion and love for all Slavic nations
12-02 18:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But yeah, pardon me while I remove my foot from my mouth now
12-02 18:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Meant absolutely nothing was just guessing
12-02 18:48 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it's OK. we are not that sensitive. I used not to correct people on this until recently
12-02 18:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's kinda a big deal though
12-02 18:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like going to Israel and calling everyone there an israeli
12-02 18:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Say that to a Palestinian and you could be in big trouble
12-02 18:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think same with Ukraine and Russia only Ukraine has a country where as the Palestinians do not
12-02 18:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I want badly to go to all the Slavic nations,  start in belarus, work my way all the way down to Bulgaria then back up and end in St Petersburg
12-02 18:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wanna see the whole eastern bloc
12-02 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If you ever wanna make me melt, speak in Ukrainian to me,  I love Slavic languages too
12-02 18:53 <unknown_105969224114245383430> now it's probably not the best time. but I highly recommend going to Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic. Russia is not so much right now.  
12-02 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am a little concerned with going to Prague to be honest
12-02 18:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> one of the most beautiful cities I ever visited
12-02 18:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause I think I'm only gonna wanna see 2 things while there. ..the job listings and the apt listings
12-02 18:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'm not gonna leave I'm pretty sure
12-02 18:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-02 19:23 <Maria la Gorda> Awesome! 
12-02 19:41 <Maria la Gorda> my awesome comment was in response to Christy finding the Smurf tears image. I sent this comment right after she posted the image. There's something wrong w/HO. It's either not sending my comments or sending my comments extremely late. 
12-02 19:42 <Maria la Gorda> From other hang out, people are having the same problem
12-02 19:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So I just about 10 min ago linked to the young house and then just a minute ago it gets taken by Jenny appleseed,  I'm sure that's just coincidence right?
12-02 20:10 <Maria la Gorda> I've noticed that some smurfs are really territorial. There was a time when Toe would come out right away when I smashed his portals. He recently took his home portals back 5 mn after I smashed them. KB was the same. 
12-02 20:10 <Maria la Gorda> It used to bother me but now I don't let it get to me. I just think that someone's playing style.
12-02 20:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Territorial is one thing,  destok is a bit territorial,  he usually will leave art deco wall (my home portal) alone unless I go smash Virginia park and the surrounding portals at which point the next morning he will come take art deco wall
12-02 20:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But vindictive is another thing entirely
12-02 20:21 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's a great way to discourage People from playing.  When I see a smurf that maybe a problem I make it a point to respond fast in Milpitas the second they do something
12-02 20:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And stalking is a third separate thing
12-02 20:22 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Downtown sj I would come out anytime of the day or night to retake anything any smurf did
12-02 20:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Each of which increase the caution I need to take for physical safety
12-02 20:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Smurfs used to come out the second Campbell would be hit or someone would take something that area has been like that for a long time
12-02 20:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Killbowls will follow after people to fluff his stats in downtown sj
12-02 20:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well, gonna go smoke a bowl now and will check back later
12-02 20:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Gilbot would follow behind people in a car
12-02 20:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I try my best to follow juggalo and and remove anything blue he does each night
12-02 20:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> This is how you discourage People and they stop taking portals because they know it will just get it
12-02 20:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hit*
12-02 20:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> A lot of people do it and it's not really stalker ish at all
12-02 20:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's the name of the game
12-02 20:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Take a portal make a portal
12-02 20:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I forget who it was (FRGLI or something?) that would follow cars on his rollerblades. 
12-02 20:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I found that entertaining. Also I cannot rollerblade anymore or that would be a brilliant way to Ingress. 
12-02 20:26 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yeah I met him before.  He is actually nice to me which was rare since most of the south bay res hates me
12-02 20:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Josh it's real nice that you don't think someone can get stalked in this game. Thank you for your valuable input
12-02 20:27 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I never said someone cannot get stalked in a game
12-02 20:28 <unknown_105969224114245383430> What I said is following and retaking portals is not very stalkerish
12-02 20:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's nice,
12-02 20:28 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Do you think you are being stalked by another woman?
12-02 20:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thank you, your insights are so refreshing
12-02 20:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Basically all I am saying is retaking portals after others do is just part of the game
12-02 20:29 <unknown_105969224114245383430> But I do not undermine any stalking or condone it
12-02 20:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wow really josh?  I had NO idea
12-02 20:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You mean the other side is supposed to actually play? Who knew!
12-02 20:30 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I hope people don't think I stalk :/ I follow and snag quick AP if I have bursters and can spam deploy extra gear. :(
12-02 20:30 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Liza hah Yeah me too
12-02 20:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza when I was resistance I used to get very dogged by you Killin all mah pretty pertals but at no time did I ever think you were anything even close to a stalker
12-02 20:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just a fierce player
12-02 20:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-02 20:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yay bowl smoking
12-02 20:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Boo haters
12-02 20:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hmm, jenny appleseed went from young house straight to 2 other portals I owned, psh, must just be coincidence
12-02 20:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Must be!
12-02 20:42 <Eric Sphoo> I followed around millburry a bit today. 
12-02 20:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-02 20:43 <Eric Sphoo> Took out a couple of his anchors. He pissed me off yesterday 
12-02 20:43 <Eric Sphoo> Followed not stalked lol 
12-02 20:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am hoping you didn't stand 2 inches from his face screaming at him and getting your spit on him!!!!
12-02 20:43 <Eric Sphoo> Nope. 
12-02 20:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Good man
12-02 20:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-02 20:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Eric how many of each you want for Edith Morley keys?
12-02 20:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I git zillions
12-02 20:45 <Eric Sphoo> Like 3-5 of each or so 
12-02 20:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 3 of each should be easy lemme double check
12-02 20:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I at least have 3 of each on the edge ones
12-02 20:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Falling water,  blue tile fountain,  etc
12-02 20:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And later tonight I hope to trespass on the trail and clear the blocking links
12-02 20:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Uhoh, I'm in a room of people I'm told I cannot trust,  I hope that bit of info doesn't slip out!
12-02 20:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-02 20:52 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have too many keys from traveling and not recycling keys :/
12-02 20:52 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Guess I should clean those out tonight. 
12-02 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Get key lockers!  They're super awesome
12-02 20:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza where did you travel to?
12-02 20:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Death Valley and southern california, then came back and then flew to AZ, then to PA and road tripped around some places there, then came back here with a stop in Salt Lake City. 
12-02 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Pa?!??
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like um
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Pennsylvania?
12-02 20:59 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yeah, into Philly. 
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woe
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wow
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sorry
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hope you were able to have fun
12-02 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's where I'm from :-)
12-02 21:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I was born in PA. Family and friends are there, I had a great time. :)
12-02 21:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I got NO LOVE for philly
12-02 21:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah? Where about?
12-02 21:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I'm a PA native too! See now that's an actual coincidence
12-02 21:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Northwest PA, in the Allegheny National Forest. 
12-02 21:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ah
12-02 21:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We lived for a few years outside of Pittsburgh when I was growing up
12-02 21:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I went to college at University of Pittsburgh. Lived there 8 years 
12-02 21:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But mostly I've lived in the very rural areas outside of philly
12-02 21:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh cool
12-02 21:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ya gotta regatta !
12-02 21:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heheh
12-02 21:03 <unknown_105969224114245383430> lol yes
12-02 21:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There's something about Pittsburgh as a city that I've always liked
12-02 21:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And it's not mister rogers house though I've been there!
12-02 21:04 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I like a lot of the outskirts of Philly. I was in West Chester visiting my new baby nephew. And I agree, I still like Pittsburgh overall. 
12-02 21:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He lived on the Carnegie Mellon campus
12-02 21:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah west Chester is where I got my drivers license
12-02 21:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's very close to where I lived
12-02 21:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm from kimberton,  pa
12-02 21:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Outside of Phoenixville
12-02 21:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's a one horse town only they don't have a horse
12-02 21:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-02 21:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ah okay, a friend of mine from college lives in Phoenixville :)
12-02 21:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Omg that you've even heard of Phoenixville is amazing
12-02 21:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Hollywood Joe - or at least that is the nickname we gave him. Although his name is Joe. lol
12-02 21:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The only claim to fame Phoenixville has is that its where the original The Blob was filmed
12-02 21:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I like that corner of PA - then I can venture into NY - NJ - MD - DE
12-02 21:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh not Delaware!
12-02 21:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Dogfish Head Brewery is in Delaware :)
12-02 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Delaware is a wasteland
12-02 21:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I did the mission for that while I was there!
12-02 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeh?
12-02 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sheeit I had no idea on that one
12-02 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Haha cool!
12-02 21:10 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I find the cool stuff everywhere I go
12-02 21:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Did you have any yuengling while you were in pa?
12-02 21:10 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
12-02 21:11 <unknown_105969224114245383430> even better
12-02 21:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't know Delaware had cool stuff
12-02 21:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh you are great
12-02 21:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's freakin awesome
12-02 21:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Their black and tans are my total favorite
12-02 21:11 <unknown_105969224114245383430> seriously, if you can find that ice cream, eat it. I'm lactose intolerant and it was worth taking my pills and being gassy. 
12-02 21:12 <Christy King> Hahaha
12-02 21:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I heard about that ice cream but have yet to try it
12-02 21:12 <unknown_105969224114245383430> maybe TMI but Yuengling Ice Cream!!!
12-02 21:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was it awesome or what
12-02 21:12 <Christy King> It's a Small World is playing in my head now.
12-02 21:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-02 21:13 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
12-02 21:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza I have to admit,  I'm totally jealous!
12-02 21:14 <unknown_105969224114245383430> outside DogFish Head Brewery in Milton, DE
12-02 21:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh badass
12-02 21:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
12-02 21:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> it was a lot of fun
12-02 21:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> All I know is one wrong turn off the Schuylkill expressway and BAM! You're in Delaware
12-02 21:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's awesome
12-02 21:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You should road trip with me, I like to find neat little things even in tiny podunk places
12-02 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I like the same sort of thing, finding weird cool shit anywhere I go
12-02 21:19 <unknown_105969224114245383430> That's what I like about Ingress. I end up exploring even more. 
12-02 21:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I've found so many parks and little spots I would have otherwise never known existed through ingress
12-02 21:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And it sounds like you had a wonderful time adventuring
12-02 21:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Which is also great to hear about!
12-02 21:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-02 21:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dtla farm tonight I guess
12-02 21:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If I only had a car
12-02 21:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or a parent or spouse who would buy one for me :-)
12-02 22:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It even looks like the dtla farm is a success so far,  that's great! It's been getting torn down so much lately I've mostly given up on it
12-02 22:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Microfarms seem like the new thing now
12-02 22:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> With frackers all you really need is for it not to get attacked for 10 min
12-02 22:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I keep hearing of these frackers
12-02 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> They're bad ass
12-02 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm a total frack head at this point :-)
12-02 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But they do cost money
12-02 22:15 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I will have to check it out sometime and gear up soon
12-02 22:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> With anomaly and all
12-02 22:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah, I'm not going to that
12-02 22:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I have axas I'm going to donate to it
12-02 22:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 100 saved up so far
12-02 22:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ooo nice!
12-02 22:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> AXAs help so much
12-02 22:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
12-02 22:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll probably keep a few for myself
12-02 22:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But yeah, been saving them for anomaly and since I'm not going I still would like those axas to go
12-02 22:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm gonna stay home and field the shit outta campbell :-)
12-02 22:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll have the place to myself I bet! :-)
12-02 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> In terms of these 100 axas I have been saving up for the anomaly,  I'm still donating them but going to see if I can officially donate them and get myself a badge for it
12-02 23:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Will keep yall posted if I can get that to work out, if not, alternative plan is to give away 10 to every person I know going til I got no more
12-02 23:33 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I would think donating gear to others on your team deserves a badge!
12-02 23:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah but it requires going through @jasonwentcrazy who has recently decided I'm no better than a "sadistic prison guard" after I guess I asked him to talk about stuff too much
12-02 23:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So uh yeah, that may or may not work out
12-02 23:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess it will depend on whether or not he can set aside his personal feelings towards me for the good of the team
12-02 23:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> (And yeah, being compared to a sadistic prison guard when all I did was try to talk was a little harsh)

12-03 05:45 <Christy King> Donating axas would be awesome. They want everyone to have a lot of those and ultra strikes. And I bet some folks would be more than willing to donate other gear to you to make room for farming before the anomoly. ;)

12-03 08:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Does anyone have info on how to donate stuff and get a badge for it
12-03 08:21 <Maria la Gorda> how many axas do you have to donate to get a badge
12-03 09:42 <Christy King> No clue. :/
12-03 09:59 <Justin Kominar> From what I understand, they won't be giving out badges for gear donation.
12-03 09:59 <Maria la Gorda> it was only for NOLA?
12-03 10:00 <Justin Kominar> I got screwed by that in Persepolis too.  Gave all the AXAs and VRs I had, and couldn't even get a silly little costs-no-one-anything digital picture on my profile  :(
12-03 10:01 <Maria la Gorda> Did you fill out a gear donation form?
12-03 10:01 <Justin Kominar> Yup
12-03 10:01 <Maria la Gorda> OH that totally sucks!
12-03 10:02 <Justin Kominar> Gave the gear, filled out the forms... was told I would get one... but then at the event, they found out from Niantic they were getting far fewer codes than they were expecting, and I apparently fell below the donation level cutoff and didn't rate one.
12-03 10:03 <Maria la Gorda> I guess one has to think twice about gear donation if one is going to an anomaly... 
12-03 10:04 <Justin Kominar> I mean, as much as it sucks, at the end of the day you still want the team to win and should donate gear regardless of the badge reward ... but it's frustrating to me that something as costless to Niantic as a digital badge code is so hard to come by when you help out at anomalies in ways other than physical presence. 
12-03 10:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn Justin that does suck
12-03 10:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You did your part and they're the ones who set the expectations there
12-03 10:44 <Justin Kominar> I think the issue was that there was a blackmarket getting created around those codes... people started to grab multiples at the anomalies and sell them on ebay and shit.  So that kinda ruined it for everyone else, and now they're much tighter about handing them out to verified present individuals.
12-03 10:44 <Maria la Gorda> there are opportunists everywhere
12-03 10:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
12-03 10:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Still, that had to have been frustrating
12-03 10:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And then you maybe feel like you're being petty to get frustrated over a badge,  at least I'd be likely to go through that
12-03 10:55 <Justin Kominar> I did... I was annoyed.  I don't get to farm a lot, and it took a LONG time for me to save up even the 25 AXAs I was able to donate.  Got over it though.  In the end, just happy the team did well.
12-03 11:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
12-03 11:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hear that
12-03 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess what I'm personally wondering is, like um, I'm still on the green enlightenment team even though banned from the hangout and g+ community?
12-03 11:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I still play, I make stuff green,  I even get together with people to play at times
12-03 11:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Green is green I don't think anyone other than Niantic can take that away from me
12-03 14:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok or not shrug
12-03 14:24 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm of little help in that situation.  Sorry.  
12-03 14:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was kinda hoping to hear an opinion or something but I'm guessing the question is inappropriate,  my apologies
12-03 14:40 <Eric Sphoo> I like that your green :) 
12-03 14:42 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You are on whatever team you choose.  I chose green, and I'm sticking with it.  You chose green, and you are green until you choose otherwise. ☺
12-03 14:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's poor form to even ask
12-03 14:48 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I argued team spirit and being heard as part of a team in another game.  I left the team and joined another because I felt I wasn't heard.  Suddenly they wanted me back and blah blah blah.  Long story short, two days later we all get a message the game is being shut down January 3rd. Until then, I will enjoy the game, even if it is by myself. ☺
Play how it makes you happy. 
12-03 14:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza why do you say at first you're of no help
12-03 14:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's some very good perspective you just offered up
12-03 14:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I thank you for that
12-03 14:54 <Maria la Gorda> I might have missed it. What was your Q?
12-03 15:20 <Christy King> Bluefish, silence in this HO doesn't mean you made anyone uncomfortable, just that everyone's busy. It's a pretty quiet chatroom, compared to all the others I've seen. =)  I haven't been online since my last post, or I'd have chimed in sooner. I think you made a perfectly valid point, and I'm glad you're green too!!
12-03 15:21 <Christy King> As far as Niantic is concerned, you are green. You could sign up through their site and just not be assigned to a team because you're not in the community. Which would be kinda dumb of our team, because if you were outside of the plan, you might make links that block us or something because you didn't know!
12-03 15:23 <Christy King> But yes, you're still green. No one can take that. There are plenty of people not in communities and they are just as enlightened. =D💚💚🐸
12-03 17:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It wasn't a good question cause the reality is I enjoy the game loads even solo
12-03 17:36 <Christy King> I know, right??
12-03 17:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways is @g3nesisclimber in this hangout
12-03 17:36 <Christy King> I don't think so
12-03 17:36 <Christy King> LG player?
12-03 17:37 <Christy King> I do recognize that name
12-03 17:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He/she totally should be
12-03 17:38 <Christy King> I was about to ask if you'd met him/her... but I realized probably not if you're saying he/she. =)
12-03 17:39 <Christy King> Anyone know / met g3nesisclimber?
12-03 17:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have been seeing this player since I was res
12-03 17:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Fierce but not one of these every spare moment players like ahem myself
12-03 17:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Good fielder,  I asked him his opinion of me flipping before I flipped and he encouraged me to do it while complimenting me at the same time
12-03 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Said you're a great fielder and enlightenment can benefit from that, paraphrased
12-03 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Never met him but seems 100% awesome to me
12-03 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or her
12-03 17:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have their Gmail ID now it's in comms
12-03 17:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hate to ask but I would like someone other than myself to reach out
12-03 17:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> As my Gmail ID is currently fucking retarded
12-03 17:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm only a guest at best anyways
12-03 17:52 <Christy King> Sweet! If you meet him/her in person, you can add after. 😊
12-03 17:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Deal.
12-03 17:52 <Christy King> Oh right... the Gmail name...
12-03 17:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And a fine criteria
12-03 17:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well I'll send him a hangout and explain
12-03 17:53 <Christy King> Sounds good!
12-03 17:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That I'm sometimes a dumbass
12-03 17:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-03 17:53 <Christy King> Hahaha
12-03 17:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It happens
12-03 17:53 <Christy King> And that you looooooooove adric. XD
12-03 17:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So much
12-03 17:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You have no idea
12-03 17:53 <Christy King> It shows.
12-03 17:54 <Christy King> Hahahahaha
12-03 17:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Love that guy!
12-03 17:54 <Christy King> Besties.
12-03 17:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Did I mention I'm thinking of changing it, when they do let me, to sadistic prison guard?
12-03 17:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-03 17:54 <Christy King> I saw the BFF matching tatoos. Stylish.
12-03 17:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I can at least laugh at all this :-)
12-03 17:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hope
12-03 17:55 <Christy King> You should! ;)
12-03 17:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Do not encourage me!
12-03 17:55 <Christy King> (Laugh, that is. Dunno about the new name hahaha)
12-03 17:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh heh ok
12-03 17:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whew
12-03 17:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I thought you were encouraging the name change
12-03 17:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This is just Bad Idea Theater
12-03 17:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-03 17:57 <Christy King> Yeah, sometimes the timing of HOs leads to some pretty funny accidental statements
12-03 17:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol, yes indeed
12-03 17:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was good :-)
12-03 19:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hm
12-03 19:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What to do what to do
12-03 19:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ride bike to saratoga?  Los gatos creek trail?  Unsure
12-03 19:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe that Westgate place
12-03 23:47 <Maria la Gorda> Tomorrow, Friday, December 4th, we will be observing an all comms, Five Minute Moment of Silence to honor the fallen agent @kojen who passed away during the San Bernardino Shooting. Please spread the word that both factions will be honoring his memory tomorrow by ceasing all activities beginning at eleven AM, the time the shootings occurred. Thank you all in advance for your support in honoring a fellow Ingress Agent.﻿

12-04 01:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That sucks bigtime
12-04 11:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Happy Friday all. I talk a lot, I know,  thanks for putting up with me :-)
12-04 11:58 <Maria la Gorda> Happy Friday to you BlueFish!!
12-04 11:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks, kinda cranky and tired. Will be sleeping much of my weekend away woo
12-04 12:49 <Josh Lehan> Vasona Park closed all day tomorrow
12-04 12:49 <Josh Lehan> Amazing my seeding there is holding
12-04 12:50 <Josh Lehan> I would walk it again at dusk but my horribly timed work meeting is then
12-04 12:50 <Justin Kominar> It's not closed all day.
12-04 12:50 <Justin Kominar> I have tickets to be in there in the evening :p
12-04 12:50 <Josh Lehan> I thought it was
12-04 12:50 <Josh Lehan> Me too
12-04 12:50 <Josh Lehan> Opens for walk through night
12-04 12:51 <Justin Kominar> Open to ticket-holders from 4:00-9:00pm or something like that.
12-04 12:51 <Justin Kominar> Yup.
12-04 12:51 <Justin Kominar> My family will be there around 5:30ish
12-04 12:51 <Josh Lehan> Anybody NOT going to anomaly who wants to hold some good mods?
12-04 12:54 <Justin Kominar> Sorry  :(  I'm anomaly-bound...
12-04 13:57 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I am not going for anomaly but my inventory is full
12-04 14:01 <Justin Kominar> Have you bought and key lockers yet?
12-04 14:01 <Justin Kominar> That took a lot of pressure off my inventory.
12-04 14:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Took pressure off inventory yeah but at the same time turned me into a hoarder
12-04 14:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Specifically,  an ingress key hoarder
12-04 14:08 <Justin Kominar> hey, more keys == more fields  ☺
12-04 14:08 <Justin Kominar> I think that's an ok hoarding condition to be afflicted with
12-04 14:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And more time spent managing
12-04 14:08 <Eric Sphoo> ###
12-04 14:08 <Eric Sphoo> Hulk smash 
12-04 15:35 <Maria la Gorda> Beautiful sight Eric!!!
12-04 16:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like fireworks :-)
12-04 16:51 <Christy King> Whoaaaaa, Eric!! That is awesome!  Downtown Campbell?
12-04 16:51 <Christy King> Happy Friday, Bluefish and all!
12-04 16:52 <Christy King> Yes, the park is closed all day tomorrow except those doing the FOL walk through. I'll be sure at least the YSI area is green when I leave... but so far, so good. Fantastic hack mods up for most of the WEEK!!!!! B-)
12-04 16:53 <Christy King> Also, after tomorrow the park trails have a hard closure at 5pm daily through the Fantasy of Lights days.
12-04 16:54 <Christy King> ###
12-04 17:05 <Josh Lehan> Wow where was that blue bursting at? I love doing that 
12-04 17:05 <Josh Lehan> Made it into Vasona! Trying to field before dusk. Work meeting cancelled. Beautiful lights already on. 
12-04 17:12 <Christy King> If you need more keys, I may have some i could drop up here. Let me know!
12-04 17:14 <Eric Sphoo> The spot I went to today was the Egyptian museum. It's almost a CCC but in a smaller area 
12-04 17:16 <Christy King> Oooh, nice. I need to go there!!
12-04 17:29 <Josh Lehan> LOL, Seeker is in park right now, even though dark has fallen 
12-04 17:29 <Josh Lehan> Would love to see him get caught 
12-04 17:29 <Christy King> Yup.
12-04 17:29 <Christy King> Josh are you out?
12-04 17:29 <Josh Lehan> Got some fields quickly up though, recharged YSI but it fell anyway - I am out 
12-04 17:30 <Josh Lehan> Sitting aside BH Road now 
12-04 17:30 <Christy King> If you're out I will say something on comm
12-04 17:30 <Josh Lehan> Cool 
12-04 17:30 <Josh Lehan> Comm, heck, say something to the rangers! 
12-04 17:30 <Josh Lehan> He is at footbridge now 
12-04 17:32 <Christy King> ###
12-04 17:33 <Christy King> The rangers patrol this time of night, so they very well might catch him.
12-04 17:33 <Christy King> I hope they do.
12-04 17:33 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
12-04 17:37 <Christy King> Josh are you still getting pings? Please screenshot with times in middle of park
12-04 17:38 <Josh Lehan> Will do - wish I had more keys for recharging 
12-04 17:38 <Christy King> I have keys. Let me know where.
12-04 17:39 <Josh Lehan> Original boiler 
12-04 17:39 <Josh Lehan> Blossom valley 
12-04 17:40 <Josh Lehan> Pitch black in there now, no excuses 
12-04 17:41 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 17:41 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 17:41 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 17:42 <Christy King> Awesome.
12-04 17:42 <Christy King> Blossom Valley is recharged.
12-04 17:42 <Christy King> I recharged boiler but he finally took it down. Should be heading out of oak meadow.
12-04 17:43 <Christy King> Josh, since he takes pics of you, perhaps it's fair to get a pic of him exiting (but still inside) the park in the dark.
12-04 17:45 <Josh Lehan> Good idea - although I was at main Vasona gate not oak 
12-04 17:46 <Christy King> Officially of course you are not supposed to take pictures. But I think him taking photos & videos of you and letting you know gives you the right to take one of him doing the same, so if it ever came up you could show the same level of proof that he tresspasses.
12-04 17:47 <Christy King> But for the record, I do not usually condone taking pics of people. He has made himself an exception.
12-04 17:47 <Josh Lehan> Playground lot sign now - I am at blossom entrance would not be surprised if he exits here 
12-04 17:48 <Christy King> Playground?? He is working his way back through the park then.
12-04 17:48 <Christy King> Probably on foot.
12-04 17:49 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 17:49 <Josh Lehan> Totally black now, I can not see a thing, watching for any light source in park 
12-04 17:51 <Christy King> Yep, playground is further in the park than blossom hill.
12-04 17:51 <Christy King> Er blossom valley
12-04 17:52 <Josh Lehan> If he was smart, he knows where I am, I threw fields from this spot as my last action 
12-04 17:53 <Josh Lehan> So when do we reconvene tomorrow for the walk through night? 
12-04 17:53 <Christy King> In case he actually has me blocked, someone else should repost what I said to him on all comm.
12-04 17:53 <Maria la Gorda> Maybe he ought to have that experience
12-04 17:53 <Christy King> I won't be here for walk through, but I can turn ysi green before I head out tonight.
12-04 17:53 <Josh Lehan> A build with lights and food trucks sounds fun 
12-04 17:54 <Maria la Gorda> there'll food trucks tomorrow?
12-04 17:54 <Josh Lehan> Cool! That will delight him, I am sure 
12-04 17:54 <Josh Lehan> There were lots last year 
12-04 17:54 <Christy King> I think you need tickets in advance so get those now if you didn't already!
12-04 17:54 <Josh Lehan> I need to give you more VRHS VRMH VRS 
12-04 17:54 <Josh Lehan> Sold out!! Got mine weeks ago 
12-04 17:54 <Maria la Gorda> I didn't know they had food trucks last year. Is it every night or only a specific night of the year?
12-04 17:55 <Josh Lehan> Only the walk through night once year 
12-04 17:55 <Christy King> Yay! But the farthest up you go in circle lot. YSI area is blocked off from FOL.
12-04 17:55 <Maria la Gorda> yeah, I'm on a hour by hour doing things... Still packing, throwing clothes away
12-04 17:55 <Christy King> There is driving (slowwwwwly) tickets the rest of Dec though.
12-04 17:56 <Christy King> He is at Coast Live Oak now, near YSI.
12-04 17:56 <Josh Lehan> He is at YSI now!! 
12-04 17:57 <Josh Lehan> Wise move for him to leave that direction 
12-04 17:57 <Josh Lehan> Recharge and rebuild it :) 
12-04 17:57 <Christy King> Go around to the dam
12-04 17:57 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 17:57 <Christy King> Oh, I will.
12-04 17:59 <Josh Lehan> No COMM traffic 
12-04 18:00 <Josh Lehan> Your message was the last 
12-04 18:01 <Christy King> He's at the dam
12-04 18:01 <Justin Kominar> Hey, do any of you know where we're supposed to enter the park for the walkthrough tomorrow?
12-04 18:01 <Christy King> ###
12-04 18:03 <Josh Lehan> ###
12-04 18:03 <Josh Lehan> Yep 
12-04 18:04 <Josh Lehan> Trail is also closed at night but not patrolled all that well so people do not care 
12-04 18:04 <Christy King> Also if you can go to dam, maybe he'll follow you after and I can leave the park without him seeing me. B-)
12-04 18:04 <Christy King> Justin, at Blossom Hill Road (main entrance)
12-04 18:05 <Christy King> Josh, I can think of one person who claims to care. SimpleSeeker. What a f'ing hypocrite.
12-04 18:05 <Josh Lehan> Part of me wants to ride through in an official vehicle and re-field the entire park tonight 
12-04 18:20 <Josh Lehan> Impressive battle at Discover Water, nice 
12-04 18:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm at oka lane
12-04 18:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woot
12-04 18:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Waiting for moar keys
12-04 18:29 <Christy King> Oh bluefish, that is peeeeeeerrrrrfect!!!
12-04 18:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then I'll nuke that blue field anchored at the post office on dell
12-04 18:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause its just right over there  --points --
12-04 18:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Threw a link back up to creative drinks fountain near home
12-04 18:32 <Christy King> Josh (and others): Brian is running the set up for the walk through tomorrow. He will be in the park when it's closed to everyone else. And... he could use a hand. Would anyone be interested in helping set up and / or clean up (meaning last ones out) tomorrow? =D=D}:)
12-04 18:33 <Christy King> He will post more details when he gets home.
12-04 18:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy I think that sort of thing is right up my alley
12-04 18:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You know what time?
12-04 18:42 <Christy King> I think set-up is 10-noonish, and clean-up is 9-11pm
12-04 18:43 <Christy King> Also, make legacy green and link the crap out of it!! He seems to be camping out at the dam. Waiting for me to drive out??
12-04 18:44 <Brian Wiebe> Yep. That's the plan for tomorrow.
12-04 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy
12-04 18:44 <Christy King> Yesss?
12-04 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Betcha I can draw seeker away
12-04 18:44 <Christy King> Do it!!!!!
12-04 18:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just took post office and made links to vasona from it
12-04 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Going next to apostolic church to link back here
12-04 18:45 <Christy King> Putting those keys to good use!!!
12-04 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Should cover all of winchester south of here in green
12-04 18:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh those keys were awesome
12-04 18:45 <Christy King> Did you hit Legacy and jcc? He and Jenny are BOTH out it seems.
12-04 18:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll take more caps of those any time
12-04 18:46 <Christy King> She just hit Eriks as he linked from dam.
12-04 18:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No I just left the trail
12-04 18:47 <Christy King> I'm giving Brian oodles of keys for tomorrow. He can share.
12-04 18:49 <Christy King> Jenny is working her way down down LG Blvd, but he seems to be staying put and linking to her work.
12-04 18:49 <Christy King> Bluefish, work your magic! If he leaves I can retake the dam.
12-04 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok somehow none of those links made the field I thought it would
12-04 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Standby
12-04 18:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh and once they start their following routine I'm just going back to work
12-04 18:52 <Christy King> Absolutely.
12-04 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> All my stuff is still there heh
12-04 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> In theory I have more work to do
12-04 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> As
12-04 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If
12-04 18:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Psh
12-04 18:56 <Christy King> Either he leaves and I take the dam, or he stays and you can make awesome fields. Either way, win. B-)
12-04 19:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There we go
12-04 19:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This is kinda like being the tank in wow
12-04 19:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Draws aggro
12-04 19:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-04 19:17 <Christy King> Make Moar links! Haha
12-04 19:17 <Christy King> It's looking gooooooood
12-04 19:18 <Christy King> Brian just hit Legacy.
12-04 19:18 <Christy King> I think he's taking out jcc next... }:)
12-04 19:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah links are opening up
12-04 19:18 <Christy King> Yeeeeah
12-04 19:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I maxed out post office so it's down to the library I go
12-04 19:20 <Christy King> Go bluefish! Go bluefish!
12-04 19:21 <Christy King> I haven't seen him on comm since the dam. Is he following you? Cuz if so, but not playing the game, that'd be straight stalking.
12-04 19:34 <Josh Lehan> Very cool, great handoff of Seeker aggro - I had to go back and finish some stuff at work and really glad to read about everybody's other efforts 
12-04 19:35 <Christy King> Jenny is back at jcc area. Not sure where Seeker is.
12-04 19:35 <Christy King> Josh, you still at work?
12-04 19:36 <Josh Lehan> Leaving now, got a party to go to tonight though 
12-04 19:36 <Christy King> You could hit up Eriks and the Kingdom Hall on the way out just for extra fun.
12-04 19:36 <Christy King> Ah gotcha.
12-04 19:36 <Josh Lehan> Might just do that 
12-04 23:56 <Josh Lehan> Any true night closure portals in JCC/Vasona area to make a field from? I am thinking the ponds and the sports facility behind the storage units
12-05 08:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I love waking up to an overcast day
12-05 10:29 <Christy King> Josh, Creekside Sports Park is like the Oak Meadow Park playground - solidly locked up at night, but small enough you can attack all the portals from outside.
12-05 10:30 <Christy King> Perc Ponds are like Vasona Park. Closed at night but not locked as solidly so someone might tresspass, but most of the portals can't be hit without going in to the park.
12-05 10:33 <Christy King> I'd still be up for a field with Vasona, Perc Ponds, and somewhere. As a note, the Fantasy Of Lights tour only goes as far as the Circle Parking Lot. They can't reach the YSI area portals at night. ...But I can. =D
12-05 12:00 <Christy King> Hmm, it looks like a couple of res agents went into the park last night or today while it's been closed.
12-05 12:01 <Christy King> Quin566 has one reso on Willow Point sign, which I don't think was there yesterday, but maybe?
12-05 12:05 <Christy King> And chivochupado puts resos on Silk Tassle Bush and Native Plant Trail (lower one on hill one; there are 2 NPT portals near each other). Both of those now-blue are near YSI, there are clear signs showing the park is closed before you can access those, and those were both definitely white when I left last night after park closed to the public.
12-05 12:07 <Christy King> And not likely someone with today's set up, since that area is not part of FOL and you have to be down on the trail to hit NPT.
12-05 13:08 <Justin Kominar> I just retook most of downtown walking back home from the Xmas parade.
12-05 13:08 <Justin Kominar> And will do what I can in the lights walk through in vasona tonight.
12-05 13:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey mostly working in vasona today but gonna try to swing back through and do portals after setup is done
12-05 14:40 <Josh Lehan> Cool I will drive down there later - forgot how bad parking was - may park anywhere I can and take the long walk in
12-05 14:44 <Justin Kominar> You can park at Daves Ave school (across from my home portal at First Baptist Church) and walk over.  It's only 0.5 mile to the park from there.
12-05 15:09 <Josh Lehan> Cool will look that up
12-05 15:39 <unknown_105969224114245383430> My bike ride to LG was fruitful. Fielded some between downtown Saratoga and LG
12-05 15:41 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Some fields need to be closed at downtown Saratoga side but I do not have time for this today anymore. 
12-05 15:44 <Paula E> Thanks krikodil I'll see if I can get over there later
12-05 15:45 <Christy King> Awesome!!
12-05 15:45 <Christy King> Josh & Justin, I believe you can also park at Netflix and they will shuttle you over.
12-05 16:12 <Justin Kominar> True but then you have to deal with the masses :p. I live close enough that it's an easy walk anyhow.  I'd have to drive further just to get to the shuttles ;-)
12-05 16:13 <Christy King> So true. And if you go Justin's route, you can deploy on an extra portal or two! =)
12-05 16:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Had fun setting up with Brian
12-05 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Key farming at garret station while my burger cooks
12-05 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am proud of myself for not ingressing when I was supposed to be working on setup
12-05 16:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It was hard!
12-05 16:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Will take out post office on my way home
12-05 16:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But then need to go home,  maybe nap
12-05 16:55 <Christy King> Guess who was first in line for tonight, haha.
12-05 16:55 <Christy King> ###
12-05 17:06 <Christy King> They didn't take Circle down! :o Drop some resos on it when you're there, please. =)
12-05 17:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I dropped resos where I could when leaving
12-05 17:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But had to get special permission so had to be quick about it
12-05 17:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Think I dropped some on circle
12-05 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok maybe a little key farming THEN home
12-05 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh
12-05 17:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Famous last words
12-05 17:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 4 hours later....
12-05 18:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok not quite that bad
12-05 19:30 <Josh Lehan> Made it to area finally after long slow drive 
12-05 19:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Traffic must be nuts
12-05 19:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 6500 tickets were pre sold for the event
12-05 20:00 <Josh Lehan> Actually 880 was bad, like a typical workday, some idiots wrecked 
12-05 20:01 <Josh Lehan> Cleared up by 27. Now at Circle portal. 
12-05 20:02 <Brian Wiebe> Nice Josh
12-05 20:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Definitely going to bed early tonight, have fun everyone
12-05 20:08 <Brian Wiebe> I'll be by there in a bit for cleanup.
12-05 20:09 <Brian Wiebe> Both bed and the park ^_^
12-05 20:27 <Josh Lehan> Cool 
12-05 20:31 <Brian Wiebe> Josh, you want to help out and be in the park late? ;)
12-05 20:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Dooooo eeeeet!
12-05 20:32 <Josh Lehan> Sure 
12-05 20:32 <Josh Lehan> Was just going to ask 
12-05 20:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The work is super easy
12-05 20:33 <Josh Lehan> Many smurfs here stymied my fielding plans 
12-05 20:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And the after hours park access will be worth it!
12-05 20:33 <Josh Lehan> Dinosaur audio nice and loud - another volunteer could be used at far back, some people were spilling out of bounds 
12-05 20:33 <Brian Wiebe> Yup, super easy.
12-05 20:34 <Josh Lehan> Where to meet and when, so I don't get booted at the close? 
12-05 20:34 <Brian Wiebe> There's supposed to be patrolling rangers for that
12-05 20:34 <Brian Wiebe> Meet at 9:30 at netflix
12-05 20:34 <Brian Wiebe> We have a bit there first
12-05 20:34 <Christy King> Awesome! Glad you can make it Josh!
12-05 20:37 <Josh Lehan> Ok where is that, or just follow crowd to buses? 
12-05 20:37 <Christy King> The park is looking nice and green, might I say! Though it already needs some recharging, wow. I'll do some from here.
12-05 20:39 <Brian Wiebe> It's on Winchester. Just before the railroad tracks on the right. There is a bunch of construction, bit follow the signs to the bus shuttle.
12-05 20:39 <Josh Lehan> Ok will go there 
12-05 20:40 <Maria la Gorda> when i type JCC, what do you guys think of?
12-05 20:40 <Josh Lehan> And I love the Daves Ave school parking trick. Thanks! Some other local families there also, so I was not alone in parking lot. 
12-05 20:41 <Christy King> Maria: Jewish Community Center, and a very rude smurf who is over-the-top in defending the portals there (SimpleSeeker and family). Why?
12-05 20:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maria that always means Jewish community center to me
12-05 20:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I worked at a few jccs
12-05 20:42 <Maria la Gorda> ok... I'm upgrading the Ingress Terms doc  ☺
12-05 20:42 <Christy King> Oh haha, good call
12-05 20:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What's that
12-05 20:42 <Maria la Gorda> because I've seen some SJ ENL players refer to San Jose City College as JCC
12-05 20:42 <Christy King> There is a googledoc they're working on for noobs
12-05 20:42 <Christy King> Wouldn't that be sjcc?
12-05 20:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh cool
12-05 20:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm a noob I wanna read it
12-05 20:43 <Maria la Gorda> That's how I type it Christy
12-05 20:43 <Maria la Gorda> Blue, scroll up. Christy posted the link
12-05 20:43 <Christy King> Josh: You can take the bus to Netflix and Brian will give you a ride to your car after, if you prefer.
12-05 20:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ooh ok thanks
12-05 20:44 <Maria la Gorda> bu apparently to others who don't know that there's is a JCC in LG, they think of the one in MV/LA border
12-05 20:44 <Christy King> Barbara, I'll share the link in here when it's ready. Right now, they are adding and defining terms
12-05 20:44 <Maria la Gorda> the JCC in LG is the only one I know of
12-05 20:44 <Maria la Gorda> oops, wrong HO Barbara
12-05 20:44 <Maria la Gorda> my bad
12-05 20:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Jcc is almost like ymca, pretty widely known term
12-05 20:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There are jcc's all over the usa
12-05 20:45 <Josh Lehan> Cool as for JCC, I wonder if seeker will try another after closure stunt like last night 
12-05 20:46 <Christy King> Yeah, exactly, there are lots of them. Maybe "jcc: Jewish Community Center, often referring to the portals at the site in Los Gatos"
12-05 20:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What did he do last night
12-05 20:47 <Christy King> Entered the park after 5 aka closing, went all the way through it AND BACK.
12-05 20:47 <Christy King> Full blown trespassing.
12-05 20:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn
12-05 20:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What a hypocrite
12-05 20:49 <Christy King> YUP.
12-05 20:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am happy to not be on his team anymore
12-05 20:50 <Christy King> Hahaha Maria, maybe add hypocrite to the definitions. Hypocrite: Yelling at people for trespassing even though you blatantly trespass. Example: SimpleSeeker. Hahahaha
12-05 20:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Granted enlightenment isn't perfect but sheesh resistance is just too much here
12-05 20:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol!
12-05 20:51 <Christy King> I am quite happy to not know him beyond the level I currently do. He strikes me as an angry, cocky jerk. :/
12-05 20:52 <Josh Lehan> The line for buses at the exit is so long it wraps the entire back parking lot - might just make it there by 2130 
12-05 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have a hard time picturing him as happy, and while playing it's not only an unhappy vibe I get but downright disturbed
12-05 20:53 <Josh Lehan> Well I am not a happy person either usually 
12-05 20:54 <Christy King> If you invest that much of yourself into a game, chances are that real life isn't doing it for you.
12-05 20:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah but you also don't seem particularly unhappy either josh
12-05 20:55 <Christy King> Josh, you've never struck me as angry or even very unhappy. But hang out with me and Brian more, maybe our weird silly happiness will rub off on ya! ;P
12-05 20:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And happy is perhaps not even the best word
12-05 20:56 <Christy King> Napoleon wannabe?
12-05 20:56 <Christy King> (Seeker, not Josh!!)
12-05 20:56 <Christy King> Just to be clear!
12-05 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh maybe yeah
12-05 20:58 <Christy King> Self proclaimed emperor of LG, hehehe.
12-05 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lolololol
12-05 21:07 <Josh Lehan> Thanks - I think I am not happy but not really unhappy either 
12-05 21:07 <Josh Lehan> Bus line slowly wrapping around, about halfway up now, might just make it 
12-05 21:08 <Josh Lehan> I like Brian from Tigo and also Christy 
12-05 21:08 <Josh Lehan> Makes me happy to be around them 
12-05 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-05 21:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Aw crap now I woke up
12-05 21:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I gotta put clothes on and go retake art deco wall
12-05 21:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause its my home portal
12-05 21:19 <Christy King> Awww
12-05 21:21 <Christy King> We like you too, Josh. And really, i have to say, all the folks in Team LG are super cool. I feel so lucky to have such a great group of people all in the same area! 😊
12-05 21:21 <Christy King> We should all go see a movie one night or something!
12-05 21:22 <Josh Lehan> Yay thanks 
12-05 21:22 <Josh Lehan> I would be up for food after tonite cleanup if interested 
12-05 21:23 <Josh Lehan> Was looking forward to food trucks but food line moving even slower than bus line! 
12-05 21:24 <Christy King> I could be down with that. It'll be late, so probably a Dennys or a Red Robin kinda thing.
12-05 21:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> About to pass out just want to echo what christy just said about team lg
12-05 21:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like this group of people a whole lot
12-05 21:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Night all
12-05 21:35 <Josh Lehan> Made it! Now at Netflix 
12-05 21:37 <Josh Lehan> As for late food, Mini Gourmet is a classic, Bascom at Moorpark 
12-05 21:48 <Justin Kominar> Thanks for dropping by my portal Josh
12-05 22:05 <Josh Lehan> You are welcome, enjoy the VR hack mod 
12-06 08:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> One of my most favorite things to do in ingress is bumping couch portal of teammates and putting good hack mods on
12-06 08:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If and when a couch portal makes it to my route
12-06 09:31 <Maria la Gorda> http://www.geeknative.com/53845/ingress-mistake-threatens-oxfordshires-man-job-augmented-reality-goes-wrong/
12-06 09:32 <Maria la Gorda> I don't think it's Niantic's fault. The player created a portal where he shouldn't. But it sucks that he'd loose his job over it. I think he's learned a valuable lesson
12-06 10:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No public access yeah
12-06 10:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I know if another agent who should read that article
12-06 10:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Local guy, works at bay I think
12-06 10:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Barracuda I meant
12-06 10:33 <Maria la Gorda> LOL
12-06 10:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-06 11:48 <Christy King> Oh daaang.
12-06 11:50 <Christy King> Herr is what I want to know: How did it get approved in the first place? I thought the reasons submissions took so long to approve was because they were checking each submission. This seems like a location they would have caught...
12-06 12:11 <Maria la Gorda> I don't think niantic has anyone checking the location of the portal. Apparently, the pentagon or the NSA building was approved as a portal, security had to ask an agent what he was doing. The agent showed security the game, & he was asked to remove the portal for national security purposes. The agent told security that they have to take that up with Niantic.
12-06 14:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-06 14:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Time for a road trip to area 51
12-06 14:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Submit portals for that place!
12-06 15:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have way too many saratoga keys
12-06 15:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Inventory cleanup
12-06 15:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wonder why simplestalker all of a sudden seems to have chilled out again
12-06 15:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh wait I'm sorry
12-06 15:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I forgot I cannot discuss in this channel
12-06 15:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nvm
12-06 15:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do worry about escalation and safety
12-06 15:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But will worry to myself
12-06 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I saw a family trespassing in comms tonight
12-06 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wouldn't want to make any accusations as that could be dangerous!  :)
12-06 20:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Really wish this channel was a safe space to talk
12-06 20:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sigh
12-06 21:55 <Maria la Gorda> Barbara, I think that's just reporting what you saw
12-06 22:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I still wish I had a safe place to speak
12-06 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not your problem or your fault
12-06 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No one's fault but mine for trusting people I shouldn't have
12-06 22:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug
12-06 22:42 <Christy King> Speaking of tresspassing
12-06 22:42 <Christy King> ###
12-06 22:42 <Christy King> Seeker is definitely escalating.
12-06 22:58 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-06 22:58 <Maria la Gorda> Look who came by to say hello
12-06 22:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy that's what I was referring to
12-06 23:00 <unknown_105969224114245383430> So much for closed at 5 PM I suppose
12-06 23:01 <Maria la Gorda> Screenshots are always good evidence 🙂
12-06 23:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> lol it's even on the web page that it should be closed
12-06 23:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Evidence for what though
12-06 23:02 <unknown_105969224114245383430> ###
12-06 23:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Niantic doesn't care I don't think
12-06 23:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't care if people trespass in parks I care more if they're being hypocrites about it or doing so to try to be creepy scary or stalkering to other people
12-06 23:04 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I just like to keep screenshots when someone tries to talk about something that they do themselves. Pot kettle quote and stuff
12-06 23:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess I don't see what would change
12-06 23:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Showing a hypocrite the proof that they're being hypocrites never helps anything
12-06 23:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That I've seen
12-06 23:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I just like to back up statements with facts. I can't guarantee change in others, but I can support statements with facts and screenshots. 
12-06 23:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't mean to sound all absolute, just only ever mean in my experience or in my opinion
12-06 23:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I just do what works for me. :)
12-06 23:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I'm not accusing anyone of anything
12-06 23:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just to be clear
12-06 23:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> No one said you did
12-06 23:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Maria and Christy were just pointing out some interesting observations. :)
12-06 23:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I know, just wanting to be very clear
12-06 23:40 <Christy King> You're right, it's pretty unlikely that having proof someone's a hypocrite will do anything to change that.
12-06 23:42 <Christy King> ...but there may be a time that Niantic cares or some other 3rd party wants proof of such things, and I'll be all too glad to have that handy.
12-06 23:44 <Christy King> Plus, if I'm telling someone else that he's a hypocrite, I like to be able to back that up with screenshots.
12-06 23:44 <Christy King> And to share it with you fine folks, so we all know what we're dealing with and can vent together.
12-06 23:46 <Christy King> It makes me sad that one player can bring so much negativity to the game, but what can you do? Just have fun kicking his ass (in the game) and laughing about what a tool he is, I guess. ;P
12-07 08:01 <Maria la Gorda> 
Does anyone know if these gloves work well?
http://www.amazon.com/Iglove-Unisex-Blackberry-Samsung-Smartphones/dp/B00A71O6LQ
12-07 08:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'd call him a tool but tools are useful
12-07 08:09 <Christy King> Maria, I don't know those specifically, but I've used touchscreen gloves from somewhere and was happy and warm
12-07 08:10 <Christy King> Barbara, true. True.
12-07 08:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Man, I dislike cheaters
12-07 08:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Alts, spoofing, using kids accounts
12-07 08:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cheating seems widespread
12-07 08:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like people will try to get away with anything they can
12-07 08:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm guessing people in seattle cheated just as much, just I never was aware of it up there
12-07 08:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I just wish I didn't have to see it
12-07 08:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm just gonna start reporting people for it
12-07 09:25 <Maria la Gorda> Barbara, you can always report misconduct against ToS to Niantic lab on their website but you'll need to show proof. So screenshots are always best. My suggestion is not to have any expectation of the outcome once you file a misconduct to Niantic. That was my experience when I reported an agent's constant bullying of ENL agents.
12-07 10:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
12-07 10:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It won't do any good
12-07 10:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cheaters will always cheat and get away with it
12-07 10:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It just sucks when you see it from someone on your own team
12-07 10:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The only proof I have is that it happened in my presence
12-07 10:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If that hadn't happened all I would have is speculation
12-07 10:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Once I see a person cheating I become suspicious of all their actions
12-07 10:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Guess we should all just cheat
12-07 10:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shrug
12-07 10:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> For the record I don't cheat
12-07 10:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't have alts or play kids accounts
12-07 10:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I offered to hold gear for folks going to the anomaly
12-07 10:31 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I have an alt. snowpupgirl is my original account (level 2 still, and also green). It's on my mother's android and linked to her gmail. I played it before it was released for iPhone. When the iPhone launch happened, I signed up that day as snowpupgiri (last letter is a capital i). That is the account I play. 
12-07 10:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You should delete that first account
12-07 10:34 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Well, if my mom plays ever again, that's her account. 
12-07 10:34 <unknown_105969224114245383430> She played for two minutes. 
12-07 10:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Am I the only one with just one account
12-07 10:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hope not
12-07 10:40 <unknown_105969224114245383430> uh, the other account I haven't played since December 2013. The account I use now was created July 2014. So I only play one account. 
12-07 10:41 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Folks on both sides are aware of my first account. 
12-07 10:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
12-07 11:43 <Maria la Gorda> I only have one: marialagorda 🙂
12-07 11:54 <unknown_105969224114245383430> My Ingress account is tied to my old google account which I do not use anymore. Unfortunately there is no way to transfer it to new one. Sometimes I am tempted to create new Ingress account and start over
12-07 12:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have more than 1 Google account
12-07 12:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> One is just for job search
12-07 12:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But only 1 ingress access
12-07 12:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Account
12-07 12:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe I should have kids and make accounts for them
12-07 12:50 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If I have kids, they can make their own accounts themselves.  I am somewhat leery of having them play a geolocational game, but that's years down the road if I even have babies.  hahaha
12-07 14:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry to be so pissy today
12-07 14:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess cheating is kind of more of a thing for me than I realized
12-07 14:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I want everyone on green enlightenment team to be awesome,  maybe want to think they are all
12-07 14:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Anyways
12-07 15:16 <Christy King> I agree. Cheating is stupid!!
12-07 15:16 <Christy King> I only have & use 1 account, too. =)
12-07 15:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I don't cheat. I only use one account. (Also my mother's phone is broken and I decided I am not fond of android phones)
12-07 15:17 <Christy King> Liza, you've got no overlap so that makes total sense to me. I didn't realize the last letter was an i!
12-07 15:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't even much play by car so am probably more irked than I should be
12-07 15:18 <Christy King> I wish I had a job that I could just leave at play Ingress all the time.
12-07 15:18 <Christy King> ###
12-07 15:18 <unknown_105969224114245383430> heh, yes, it's too easy to make two accounts that look like the same name. 
12-07 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Heh you'd have to level them evenly
12-07 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> To get away with it
12-07 15:20 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Naw, I don't have time (or the desire ever) for two accounts. I can't even get to 16 on one XD
12-07 15:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol right?
12-07 15:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza I didn't try to imply you are cheating earlier
12-07 15:20 <unknown_105969224114245383430> It's also why I tell people the two accounts. They can look and check and see the level 2 account stay at level 2 ;)
12-07 15:21 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Naw I understand :)I still will disclose, and if people get mad I understand. I still will only play one. 
12-07 15:23 <Christy King> Holy lord! A coordinated attack!
12-07 15:24 <Christy King> ###
12-07 15:24 <Christy King> Which is funny, because I could swear the emperor of LG said he singlehandedly takes stuff down.
12-07 15:24 <Justin Kominar> I never said that ...  ;)
12-07 15:25 <Justin Kominar> Oh ... THAT emperor...
12-07 15:25 <Christy King> No sir. You are the Lord of LG though. Very different.
12-07 15:25 <Justin Kominar> 👑
12-07 15:25 <Christy King> ;)
12-07 15:25 <Christy King> Ah, but I'd have to claim King of LG... It's in my name!
12-07 15:26 <Christy King> Hahaha
12-07 15:27 <Christy King> But Liza, I think you are smart to disclose that you used a different account before, so it's not hiding anything. But you're not using both at once or anything, so it's totally not cheating.
12-07 15:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin you have my vote for emporer of lg
12-07 15:29 <Christy King> You would make a far better emperor. Although... I don't think that most emperors use a voting system hahaha.
12-07 15:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> True
12-07 15:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Still
12-07 15:30 <Justin Kominar> lol ... I have no interest in the job  :P
12-07 15:30 <Justin Kominar> We're an autonomous collective!
12-07 15:31 <Christy King> Fine. I dub thee "6 of 15"
12-07 15:31 <Christy King> =D
12-07 15:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-07 15:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Can I be 7 of 9
12-07 15:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> She was hawt
12-07 15:32 <Justin Kominar> You need a pretty serious body suit to pull of that role on the team.
12-07 15:32 <Christy King> Only if you can pull off that outfit haha
12-07 15:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I got the tummy for it just not the boobs
12-07 15:32 <Christy King> ...but she DOES pull Simple's attention to her pretty effectively. So, YES.
12-07 15:33 <Christy King> There's water bras for that
12-07 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What the shit is a water bra!
12-07 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Don't answer I don't wanna know
12-07 15:34 <Christy King> An appealing lie?
12-07 15:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-07 17:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Think I lost sojourner
12-07 17:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ah well
12-07 17:23 <Christy King> Oh no!! How far along were you? =(((((
12-07 18:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't know maybe 93 days
12-07 18:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I might not have lost it
12-07 18:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hacked some portals just now
12-07 18:37 <Christy King> Did you check your stats before & after?
12-07 18:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No
12-07 18:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lemme see
12-07 18:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh longest hack streak is actually 64 days
12-07 19:28 <Justin Kominar> Oh that would break my heart at this point.  I'm at 267 days I think.
12-07 19:29 <Justin Kominar> Hope you're still on track!
12-07 19:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well I'll never get 365 days
12-07 19:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Burningman
12-07 20:22 <Justin Kominar> You don't need your phone in the desert anyhow.. .just leave it with someone to hack with while you're away  ☺
12-07 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do needy phone!
12-07 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's my alarm clock
12-07 20:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Plus gerlach has 7 portals
12-07 21:06 <Justin Kominar> I'm sure you can get a dollar store alarm clock, and really, is 7 portals really worth the epic onxy sojourner?  :P   I think you know what you must do!
12-07 23:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-07 23:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You crack me up
12-08 07:16 <Christy King> Couldn't you hack those 7 portals for sojourner?
12-08 07:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If I left burningman every day yeah maybe
12-08 07:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gerlach is a small town outside of the event
12-08 07:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We do have a ranger outpost there at crow and keepers house, 2 rangers that live in town, and they have wifi, but I just don't care about ingress too much while at burningman
12-08 07:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm not married to sojourner or guardian
12-08 11:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Tell me who gets to have a job where they can leave for hours every single day for months on end
12-08 11:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't know anyone with a job like that
12-08 11:02 <Justin Kominar> Some people are "on call" 24x7 so they end up with quite flexible work schedules since they're always technically working.
12-08 11:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I suppose
12-08 11:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm leaning towards thinking a certain smurf isn't actually employed
12-08 11:04 <Justin Kominar> haha ... yeah, nice work if you can get it :
12-08 11:04 <Justin Kominar> :P
12-08 11:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Right?
12-08 11:12 <Christy King> Are there jobs like that in tech support though, or just like a surgeon or fire fighter?
12-08 11:19 <Paula E> Yes my sister-in-law works for a law firm and is on call 24 seven
12-08 11:20 <Paula E> As tech-support
12-08 11:33 <Christy King> Wow! That would be crazy. They should at least have 2 people in shifts so you can take a break sometimes. Brian used to be on-call sometimes, but I can't imagine 24/7.
12-08 11:33 <Christy King> ...Would be good for ingress though.
12-08 11:33 <Christy King> You should recruit her!  :)
12-08 11:35 <Paula E> She's the one who recruited me she's coming here for the anomaly
12-08 11:39 <Paula E> My brother is on call 24 seven also it works well for the two of them
12-08 11:46 <Christy King> Do they get called in often?
12-08 11:47 <Christy King> When Brian was on-call, they called him lots. At all hours. It was rough.
12-08 11:56 <Josh Lehan> My Sojourner streak is at 224 days now
12-08 11:56 <Christy King> 😍
12-08 11:56 <Christy King> Mine is 143
12-08 12:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ah didn't lose sojourner after all
12-08 12:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Woo
12-08 12:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm at 65 days
12-08 12:45 <Maria la Gorda> I'm at 74 days but I have no clue whether I lost it or not
12-08 12:55 <Justin Kominar> 268
12-08 13:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hey so
12-08 13:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'd like to start giving out axas for the anomaly
12-08 13:08 <Justin Kominar> I'd like to start receiving them!  :P
12-08 13:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Who are the takers
12-08 13:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've got 110 of em saved up
12-08 13:34 <Justin Kominar> I'll take whatever you want to give.  I'm 62 shy of the recommended gear load-out.
12-08 13:35 <Justin Kominar> No way I'm gonna grow/farm that many in a few days.
12-08 13:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think I'm gonna end up running into an issue of actually getting time to meet up with folks to give em out
12-08 13:41 <Justin Kominar> if you're at your place, I can stop on the way home tonight... ~6pm eta
12-08 13:41 <Justin Kominar> Maybe 5:30.
12-08 13:42 <Justin Kominar> Otherwise, later in the evening 10/11pm tomorrow is an option to visit.
12-08 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's a better option for me, tomorrow
12-08 13:42 <Justin Kominar> ok
12-08 13:42 <Justin Kominar> can do
12-08 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And between now and then I'll try to find out other takers
12-08 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll send you off with 62 if I can sure
12-08 13:43 <Justin Kominar> Sure... happy to take all and redistribute to others if scheduling meet-ups is tough for you too.
12-08 13:43 <Justin Kominar> Whatever's easiest on you
12-08 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah that might actually be a good option too
12-08 14:17 <Josh Lehan> I see Squeaker is active again
12-08 14:17 <Josh Lehan> I am good on Axa, have enough, I think
12-08 14:17 <Josh Lehan> Have more hack mods also
12-08 14:18 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Ooo, I can meet and snag AXAs if you are offloading, bluefish. ☺
12-08 15:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Squeaker lololol
12-08 15:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza yeah, saved em up for anomaly but not going
12-08 15:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But want team to have em
12-08 15:11 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yay!  Sounds good.  Let me know when works for you, I am in Los Gatos until about 4:30 ish most days.
12-08 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Also think I wanna make sure sphoo has some more
12-08 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've got 110 for anomaly to divvy up
12-08 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Think Justin gets at least 50
12-08 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe 60
12-08 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then 25 to liza and 25 to sphoo? Not sure
12-08 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Some definitely go to sphoo
12-08 15:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza what's your current axa count look like
12-08 15:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wanna divvy them up well
12-08 15:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How josh paula and christy
12-08 15:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If yall lmk what your counts are, I can probably figure out best way to split em up
12-08 15:18 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I am at 44 right now
12-08 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
12-08 15:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What's the recommended number
12-08 15:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Basically I wanna even it all out if I can
12-08 15:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Get as many of you as close as I can to the recommended number
12-08 15:22 <Josh Lehan> I have 189 Axa
12-08 15:23 <Justin Kominar> Think the suggested load varies depending on your role.
12-08 15:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Holy crap
12-08 15:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh Jesus josh
12-08 15:23 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm aiming for 100 hahaha
12-08 15:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You don't need any
12-08 15:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-08 15:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You have a metric truckload
12-08 15:24 <Josh Lehan> Thanks
12-08 15:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Would anyone be up to meet in lg tomorrow evening
12-08 15:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe grab a drink
12-08 15:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Could be a little axa party
12-08 15:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hehe
12-08 15:28 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Yay AXA party!  Tomorrow I have to shop for groceries and restock my house, but if it's after 7:30 pm I would be interested!
12-08 15:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah was thinking a little later
12-08 15:30 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Count me in!
12-08 15:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin you're not available til a bit later right?
12-08 15:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I would like to hear back from christy and paula and sphoo before figuring out how much to give to each person
12-08 15:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula, if you're around lmk if you need any extra axa for this weekend pls
12-08 15:34 <Justin Kominar> It'd be earlier tonight (5:30/6) or later tomorrow after I farm DTLA (10/11)
12-08 15:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just you and I may need to coordinate separately
12-08 15:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin I meant
12-08 15:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't want time to get away from us to get these out to folks
12-08 15:35 <Justin Kominar> No prob.  I'll survive with the gear I have too, so don't stress about it.
12-08 15:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Aw no stress here man
12-08 15:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Is all good
12-08 15:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I want enlightenment to kick smurfs asses
12-08 15:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Badly
12-08 15:48 <Justin Kominar> Are you around on Saturday and just not going to the anomaly?  We should plan on greening LG while we're all away in Oakland.  His family should come back exhausted on gear.  Would be a shame to run into 4xVRS portals all over the place  ;)
12-08 15:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh yeah Justin didn't I mention
12-08 15:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm staying back from the anomaly and I'm gonna field the ever lovin shit outta campbell and anything else south and west I cam bike to
12-08 15:52 <Justin Kominar> Nice
12-08 15:52 <Justin Kominar> I can leave you some VR shields in exchange for the AXAs so you can shield it all up too
12-08 15:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The trail, lg, Westgate saratoga
12-08 15:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> All of it
12-08 16:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am all out of rare and vr shields
12-08 16:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Got 108 commons though
12-08 16:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-08 16:10 <Paula E>  Thanks for the offer of axa's but I'm good.
12-08 16:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> K
12-08 16:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Thanks for getting back to me :-)
12-08 17:57 <Christy King> Brian and I are on the fence for saturday. I don't feel comfortable with oakland, esp with the police stuff happening lately in SF and Chicago.
12-08 17:58 <Christy King> I have an mufg full of axa, but Brian only has a few. So we'll either have some to donate or we'll need some. Same with US8.
12-08 17:59 <Christy King> If we don't go (or get an assignment outside of oakland helping out), we will be greening it uuuuuuuup around here.
12-08 18:00 <Christy King> I would LOVE to meet up, but tomorrow night we have a holiday party, I think 6-10pm or so
12-08 18:01 <Christy King> I'll double check the times. If it starts a little later like 8 and i can swing by, I will!
12-08 18:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah let's have some holiday cheer tomorrow evening
12-08 18:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How bout that black watch place in dtlg
12-08 18:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That place is pretty good
12-08 19:45 <Christy King> First onyx!!!!!  Woot woot!
12-08 19:45 <Christy King> ###
12-08 19:53 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-08 19:54 <Paula E> Congrat christy!!
12-08 19:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yay!
12-08 19:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Grats!
12-08 20:02 <Josh Lehan> Cool
12-08 20:05 <Christy King> Thanks!!
12-09 10:36 <Brian Wiebe> Ya, just reach 10.08 in credit so I got key lockers!
12-09 10:57 <Paula E> I found those super helpful 
12-09 15:15 <Christy King> Yayyyyy!!!
12-09 15:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> How does one get credits
12-09 15:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And was anyone still interested in a meet up tonight in lg?
12-09 15:40 <Justin Kominar> I may be able to, but I'm just not 100% sure when yet.  I have a meeting in SJ until 9ish, then I was hoping to hit up DTLA to farm one last time before the weekend... so I have no idea when I'd be back in LG really :()
12-09 15:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
12-09 15:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No problem
12-09 16:08 <Christy King> I've got a holiday event tonight,.but if it ends before 9 I could swing by LG after if y'all are meeting up
12-09 16:14 <Christy King> Oh, credits. It's through google rewards
12-09 16:15 <Christy King> Earn Google Play credit by answering short surveys. Download Google Opinion Rewards now: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks
12-09 16:15 <Christy King> I couldn't wait for key lockers (Addict!!!) But I've used credits for movie downloads.
12-09 16:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-09 17:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am assuming no meet up tonight
12-09 17:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza I shoulda just given you axas last night
12-09 17:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I feel kinda cruddy today
12-09 18:07 <Christy King> I know what will make you feel better...
12-09 18:07 <Christy King> Take these out!
12-09 18:07 <Christy King> ###
12-09 18:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I was gonna take out barracuda tonight when I leave work
12-09 18:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If anyone wanted to stop by tonight or tomorrow night and get some axas to bring to anomaly lmk, I'll be around
12-09 19:38 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Oh dang, yeah, I didn't know if you wanted to wait until you heard from others or not. 
12-09 20:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Much improved
12-09 20:38 <Christy King> You took em out?
12-09 20:39 <Christy King> Etgyerthtbt
12-09 20:39 <Christy King> Translation: Greetings from my cat.
12-09 20:39 <Christy King> 😺
12-09 20:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I made it better
12-09 20:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah took out some stuff
12-09 20:40 <Justin Kominar> Blue, I'm maybe 15 mins from art Deco.  Still available for gear drop?
12-09 20:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin absolutely yes please!
12-09 20:49 <Justin Kominar> K
12-09 20:49 <Justin Kominar> Eta 10
12-09 20:49 <Justin Kominar> Mins
12-09 20:49 <Justin Kominar> Not pm
12-09 20:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok I'll throw 40 axa in a capsule
12-09 20:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ping me when you get here
12-09 20:55 <Christy King> Wow, I can have all the badges needed for Level 16 by the end of January!! ...Meanwhile, I'm due to hit Level *11* later this week.
12-09 20:56 <Justin Kominar> Just pulling in
12-09 20:57 <Justin Kominar> Here
12-09 20:58 <Paula E> Christy that's exciting!! 
12-09 20:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok coming out 1 sec
12-09 21:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well that was fucked up
12-09 21:17 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just lost 80 axa
12-09 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Put em in capsules,  dropped one and Justin got a weird error about cannot use
12-09 21:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then capsule was empty
12-09 21:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Tried again,  same thing
12-09 21:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hope all those axas show back up somewhere
12-09 21:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's a huge bummer
12-09 21:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> 80 axas
12-09 21:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Grr
12-09 21:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> New capsules showed up in his inventory they just showed up empty
12-09 21:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wtf
12-09 21:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Axas don't expire, right?
12-09 21:33 <Maria la Gorda> It could be a server error. It's happened to me
12-09 21:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Some of them I grew from a mufg,  I assume those can get given away
12-09 21:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah I restarted the whole app and cleared cache twice
12-09 21:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Even has Justin drop all his grey capsules and I picked them up
12-09 21:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But they were empty
12-09 21:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Still have them
12-09 21:35 <Maria la Gorda> D:
12-09 21:36 <Maria la Gorda>  Yeah definitely an error with Yantic lab
12-09 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah that's way fucked up
12-09 21:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I saved those axas up a long time too
12-09 21:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I keep double checking my inventory and seeing if capsules are still on the ground
12-09 21:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ug
12-09 21:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That sucks
12-09 21:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Kinda stunned that just happened even
12-09 22:37 <Justin Kominar> Super bummer  :(
12-10 06:51 <Christy King> Could someone else have been nearby and picked them up?
12-10 06:54 <Christy King> There was a time Zach dropped me a capsule full of Eriks keys at the park back gate but when I got there I got an empty capsule. We figured Seeker or Jenny found it, and dropped back the empty capsule.
12-10 07:27 <Justin Kominar> There was a suspicious car nearby, so we had considered that, however my scanner clearly displayed a capsule error message each time I attempted to pick them up, then they were just gone...
12-10 07:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nothing showed up in your inventory I guess?
12-10 07:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nothing showed back up in mine
12-10 08:25 <Justin Kominar> Nope :(
12-10 08:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Mine neither
12-10 08:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shitty
12-10 08:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I definitely dropped capsules with axa on them
12-10 08:39 <Justin Kominar> Its really strange that the MUFG's worked, but the regular ones seemed to fail.
12-10 08:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
12-10 08:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sucks that the game would actually lose 80 axa
12-10 08:43 <Justin Kominar> Yeah ... and GhostRider took out my desk P8 last night, so I'm sitting on a blue P1 right now too  :(
12-10 08:43 <Justin Kominar> Oh well
12-10 08:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ugh that's crappy
12-10 08:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe I should take up cheating
12-10 08:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Seems like a popular choice
12-10 08:44 <Justin Kominar> Naw ... don't cave
12-10 08:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wont
12-10 08:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just annoyed
12-10 08:47 <Justin Kominar> Yeah ... well, at least it wasn't a capsule full of really hard to get keys.
12-10 08:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> True
12-10 12:13 <Maria la Gorda> It happens to me a lot, actually. Specially when I'm fielding :-( I've come to accept that it's a defect of the APP.
12-10 12:13 <Maria la Gorda> But I was sure pissed when it happened to me the first times... 
12-10 13:07 <Christy King> So I've seen that error message before, but it was when Brian and I both went to pick up a capsule or key at the same time. If he got to it first, and I clicked acquire just after (but before my screen had refreshed to show it wasn't there), it said error. I'd guess it was the suspicious car.
12-10 13:08 <Christy King> The only other time I've had error messages with capsules is if I'm trying to load or unload and there's bad signal, and then my inventory just doesn't change. Sometimes restarting the app or my phone helps that. Justin, did you do a restart too?
12-10 13:25 <unknown_105969224114245383430> If somebody will be passing through Saratoga Ulula and I will appreciate upgrade of our work portal "Joshua Hendy Machine Works". We farm it while at the office  ☺
12-10 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy for it to have been the suspicious car would have meant me then drawing conclusions that extend way beyond paranoia
12-10 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It would mean someone knew we were about to so a gear swap
12-10 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And went and waited by the portal
12-10 13:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Even I am not THAT paranoid
12-10 13:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Plus why didn't they grab the red capsule then that I dropped with another 15 in it
12-10 13:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Furthermore
12-10 13:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> The capsules showed up in justin inventory seconds later, empty
12-10 13:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't think it was that car or someone lying in wait for me to do a gear drop
12-10 13:47 <Christy King> Well they could have been there to attack a portal and happened to have seen the capaule, and dropped an empty... but you're right, there are too many IFs for that.
12-10 13:48 <Justin Kominar> I really don't think my scanner would have shown the the capsule error message that was showing up if that was the case.
12-10 13:49 <Justin Kominar> There's no way they could have picked it up, and dropped a replacement that fast.
12-10 13:49 <Justin Kominar> I think it was a glitch ... not a bad actor.
12-10 13:50 <Christy King> Yeah...
12-10 13:50 <Christy King> That just sucks so much!!!
12-10 13:51 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It does yeah
12-10 13:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I don't think it was another agent
12-10 13:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That's just a leap I don't think we can make
12-10 13:53 <Christy King> Yup, I got that.
12-10 13:54 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do realize some of the shit that comes outta my mouth can be construed as somewhat paranoid  :-)
12-10 13:56 <Justin Kominar> 98% sure that person hanging around was just waiting for someone to come out of the movie theatre.
12-10 14:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah
12-10 14:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I kinda peeked in their car window and didn't even see a phone or anything glowing on their lap
12-10 14:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't get super close though
12-10 14:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Creep factor and all
12-10 14:47 <Christy King> Should've pasted yourself against the window, like one of those window clings. And yelled "Ahhhhhhh!"
12-10 14:48 <Christy King> XD
12-10 14:50 <Justin Kominar> Or walked around and dropped R1's in a pattern on the ground that spells "WE KNOW YOU ARE HERE"
12-10 15:08 <Christy King> Hahaha, yes! Although you'd have to know it's an ingress player. When in doubt, I think creepin' up against a car window will definitely let that stranger know "I see you." ;P
12-10 15:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-10 15:28 <Maria la Gorda> She's being loaded 😭😭😭😭
12-10 15:28 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-10 15:40 <Christy King> Aw, you should have driven out. SO MANY UNIQUES!!!
12-10 15:57 <Maria la Gorda> I wanted to drive out but the company only pays one third of the gas
12-10 16:32 <Christy King> That's lame!!
12-10 16:32 <Christy King> Are you all packed?
12-10 16:33 <Maria la Gorda> No 😭😭😭😭
12-10 16:34 <Christy King> ###
12-10 16:34 <Christy King> He feels your pain. ;)
12-10 16:36 <Maria la Gorda> I wish she could pack for me and I can go ingress
12-10 16:36 <Maria la Gorda> He
12-10 20:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe will retake trail tonight
12-10 20:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Shit I dunno
12-10 20:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not really sure why I even mention it
12-10 20:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Back to your regularly scheduled anything else
12-10 20:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> On that 80 lost axa thing, tries dropping all capsules and picked them up,  no return of those 80 axa
12-10 20:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bummer
12-10 20:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sigh
12-10 20:53 <Justin Kominar> hmm... Seeker's portal is the only P8 around.. and it's green so I can't smash it.  Considering going and farming  :P
12-10 20:53 <Justin Kominar> He has hack mods...
12-10 20:53 <Justin Kominar> Wonder when it was flipped... maybe it's better to smash it.
12-10 20:54 <Justin Kominar> Looks like 8:12pm
12-10 20:54 <Justin Kominar> So I could ADA it back at 9:12
12-10 20:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sounds like good times
12-10 21:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Have fun
12-10 21:05 <Justin Kominar> Off I go
12-10 21:06 <Justin Kominar> Wonder if I'll run into him...
12-10 21:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Good luck
12-10 21:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'd say something else if this were a safe space,  sigh
12-10 21:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I know I know
12-10 21:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> There are no safe spaces
12-10 21:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not here not anywhere
12-10 21:16 <Justin Kominar> Going for a burn out before I try and trash it.  Really could use more x8 and u8
12-10 21:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cool
12-10 21:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Have fun
12-10 21:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Could come help if u want
12-10 21:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But guessing you have it under control
12-10 21:22 <Justin Kominar> Depends how aggressively he tries to save it when he catches on.  Don't want to waste too much of my own gear trying to deprive him of this portal.
12-10 21:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just knock mods off :-)
12-10 21:22 <Justin Kominar> Also, he can naturally remake a p7 with the fam after I leave
12-10 21:23 <Justin Kominar> So it's not worth me doing anything other that removing the r8s that aren't his.
12-10 21:23 <Justin Kominar> Especially if it ends up looking like I have a fight on my hands.
12-10 21:24 <Justin Kominar> I know he's active..  He commed someone recently.. so he'll be paying attention.
12-10 21:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Probably
12-10 21:26 <Justin Kominar> He's at the corner.
12-10 21:27 <Justin Kominar> Just filled out legacy church and threw a link
12-10 21:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-10 21:27 <Justin Kominar> In the rain
12-10 21:27 <Justin Kominar> At the scene of a car accident with the police all around.
12-10 21:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Whoa
12-10 21:27 <Justin Kominar> A Honda Fit got smashed pretty bad at the lights there just before I came in
12-10 21:28 <Justin Kominar> The cops weren't even on scene yet when I passed by
12-10 21:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yikes
12-10 21:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Um
12-10 21:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Did you see if anyone needed help or anything?
12-10 21:29 <Justin Kominar> Front end of the car is totally smashed. . Looks like no serious injuries though.  Didn't see any looks of panic or terror or sadness on a tone standing around waiting for cops.
12-10 21:29 <Justin Kominar> They seemed to have things order control, and like I said,  the authorities are there now.
12-10 21:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
12-10 21:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You kinda made it sound like bodies were strewn across the road
12-10 21:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bloodied and mangled
12-10 21:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Glad that is not the case
12-10 21:35 <Justin Kominar> No..  Not that bad,or I cert2would have stopped to help.  But the fit's entire engine/front was compressed in.  The car looked like someone should have been hurt a lot more...
12-10 21:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I hope no one died
12-10 21:35 <Justin Kominar> The accident was right in the intersection. But involved cars were still somehow able to pull in front of the church to clear the road...
12-10 21:36 <Justin Kominar> So even the fit could still move...  I'd go take a pic but I don't want seeker to see me.
12-10 21:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe someone trying to get on the highway too quickly
12-10 21:37 <Justin Kominar> The were heading away from 17... Towards Winchester.
12-10 21:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh
12-10 21:37 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe just people in Christmas frenzy then
12-10 21:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hm that reminds me
12-10 21:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> First bay area Xmas in like 20 years
12-10 21:39 <Justin Kominar> 2nd ever, for us
12-10 21:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Bout the same as the last one for me
12-10 21:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Living in fear
12-10 21:40 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :/
12-10 21:42 <Justin Kominar> Well hope this year turns out to be better for you.
12-10 21:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> You don't have to say that but thank you for the kind thoughts
12-10 21:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't have any illusions that we're friends,  just teammates,  which is ok
12-10 21:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Teammates is better than nothing
12-10 21:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> For sure
12-10 21:49 <Justin Kominar> I don't need to be friends OR teammates with anyone to wish them well...  :)
12-10 21:49 <Justin Kominar> Just good human being-ness
12-10 21:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok
12-10 21:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sorry
12-10 21:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll just stop trying to say things
12-10 21:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sorry
12-10 21:50 <Justin Kominar> No, no reason to be sorry...  My point was simply that I don't really wish anyone ill will and hope everyone is happy, that's all.
12-10 21:52 <Justin Kominar> K...  Burn out complete.  Time to dry up his well.
12-10 21:57 <Justin Kominar> Heh..  No resistance....  Pardon the pun
12-10 23:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well that was interesting
12-10 23:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just had wendy show up to return an air filter I loaned her
12-10 23:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Accompanied by palko
12-10 23:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And paula
12-10 23:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And millburray
12-10 23:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Strange
12-10 23:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Don't recall inviting most of those people on to the property
12-10 23:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Strange
12-10 23:06 <Christy King> Isn't millburray blue??
12-10 23:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ayup
12-10 23:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> He sure is
12-10 23:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't actually want him to know which apt was mine and find the action to be pretty aggressive
12-10 23:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Like, I wouldn't bring Travisbickle407 to her front door
12-10 23:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But hey
12-10 23:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Since when has my own feelings of safety been an actual concern
12-10 23:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh that's right,  never.
12-10 23:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And now it's just a panic attack,  thanks to those who helped
12-10 23:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I see paula is actively reading this channel
12-10 23:14 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was a little fucked up paula
12-10 23:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> None of you had any right to show him my actual apartment door
12-10 23:16 <unknown_105969224114245383430> What is happening? Are you okay?
12-10 23:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula please don't come on to my property again
12-10 23:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza mostly just a panic attack right niw
12-10 23:17 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I don't believe anyone in this chat would do anything to endanger you. 
12-10 23:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> They just did
12-10 23:20 <Christy King> Is millburray another travisbickle?
12-10 23:20 <Christy King> I thought he was an ok smurf
12-10 23:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Last time I saw him he stood an inch from my face screaming at me
12-10 23:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> His spit got on me
12-10 23:21 <Christy King> Ew
12-10 23:21 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hell no I didn't want him knowing which apartment was mine
12-10 23:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was fucked up
12-10 23:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy I like this hangout but um, well
12-10 23:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I don't care who is friends with who I really dont
12-10 23:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But for tucks sake remain neutral
12-10 23:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And that has not happened tonight
12-10 23:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> To the point where I niw feel unsafe in my own goddammed apartment
12-10 23:25 <Maria la Gorda> Barbara, what happened? Did the RES do something to your place 
12-10 23:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Went outside for a smoke
12-10 23:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I guess right as wendy was returning an air purifier I loaned her
12-10 23:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> My patio area is right next to my front door and I heard a noise at the door and said excuse me hello?
12-10 23:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Saw wendy who said she was returning the air purifier
12-10 23:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Then from around the corner came palko
12-10 23:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula
12-10 23:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And millburray
12-10 23:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I politely thanked wendy for the return of items
12-10 23:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I guess it's pretty clear paula felt a need to pick sides and not mine
12-10 23:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> This after her telling josh I was looking for meth
12-10 23:30 <Maria la Gorda> What did mulberry do?
12-10 23:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Something I've done a little bit of but which paula appears to live on
12-10 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> None of them threatened me or anything maria but seriously I didn't want him knowing which apartment was mine
12-10 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I really didn't
12-10 23:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula what on earth would make you think that was ok to do
12-10 23:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I assume you're pissed cause I called you out on the cheating stuff
12-10 23:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And cause I know what you've said to josh about me
12-10 23:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And was trying to not have either affect my life too much
12-10 23:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But you helped bring him to my front fucking door
12-10 23:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Grady offered to bring me the air purifier too
12-10 23:34 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So it's not like no other options were out there
12-10 23:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I would never bring anyone who wasn't invited to any of your front doors
12-10 23:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I expect the same in exchange
12-10 23:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If that's not reasonable let me know
12-10 23:41 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula why on earth did you just take part in that
12-10 23:44 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I let people know exactly where I live on a very selective basis
12-10 23:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> My whole ability to feel safe revolves around that
12-10 23:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And you just took part in trampling that
12-10 23:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> WHAT. THE FUCK
12-10 23:55 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Waiting for paula to say anything to justify tjis, to have this make sense
12-10 23:56 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula are you that pissed that I caught you cheating? You know that actually tore me up in terms of how to try to talk to you about it
12-10 23:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or are you mad that I don't wanna do speed with you
12-10 23:58 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause I'm otherwise at a freakin loss hete
12-10 23:58 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I think this all was a miscommunication, you are very angry and emotional and Paula could be waiting for you to cool down before responding. I know you want answers now and I can understand that, and it seems like they didn't mean you harm. Perhaps this conversation would be better in a more private message and not the Los Gatos team chat?
12-10 23:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I have sent her many messages this evening,  she is not going to respond
12-10 23:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> However
12-11 00:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I understand you do not want me to talk about this anymore
12-11 00:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Out of fear I will oblige
12-11 00:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I just feel that the situation will not get resolved this way. 
12-11 00:01 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I'm sorry you are upset and hope that things get better for you. 
12-11 00:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Is there some way I should resolve this that I haven't tried?
12-11 00:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cause I've tried talkinh
12-11 00:03 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And I've tried the being firm but calm route
12-11 00:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wait
12-11 00:05 <unknown_105969224114245383430> You stated to them your discomfort of people showing up uninvited. Some people don't mind it, some do, it's a common mistake. Now they are aware, and they can respond when things have cooled down a bit. 
12-11 00:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Liza I need to ask
12-11 00:05 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Does wendy live with you
12-11 00:06 <unknown_105969224114245383430> (People tend to show up at my house all the time uninvited, but I grew up with that)
12-11 00:06 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've been extremely clear with wendy and paula about my privacy
12-11 00:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Also, I do not disclose information about other players. It's why I called people out before for using anything other than gamer names in chats. 
12-11 00:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> Just a personal choice for me. 
12-11 00:07 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And if you're saying bringing people to my front door was fine
12-11 00:07 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I did not say that was fine. 
12-11 00:08 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I said you did just make it clear in here. 
12-11 00:08 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Do you live with wendy
12-11 00:09:22 *** unknown_105969224114245383430 removed user 'unknown_114816176869927964065' from conversation
12-11 00:09 <unknown_105969224114245383430> I answered your question. I don't respond to personal questions about other players. 
12-11 00:09:37 *** unknown_105969224114245383430 removed user 'unknown_105828790263746024880' from conversation
12-11 00:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Ok sorry didn't realize that's what you meant
12-11 00:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So I'm supposed to be ok with paula here even though she lives on meth,  cheats, and now threatens my safety
12-11 00:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Am not ok with any of these things
12-11 00:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Tell ya what I'll do
12-11 00:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'll eat some pills
12-11 00:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Helpful ones
12-11 00:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Proper dose and everything
12-11 00:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That was way fucked up though
12-11 00:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I wouldn't ever do that to anyone here and expected the same in response
12-11 00:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Out if respect for fellow teammate
12-11 00:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> And part of being in a smaller hangout requires trust that yall would respect my privacy
12-11 00:50 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I am at a loss for how any of this is okay
12-11 00:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Paula just to be real clear, please don't come to my apartment ever again.  Don't bring people you know hate me here don't tell them where I live or my phone number
12-11 01:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Please disclose no information about me
12-11 01:01 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've respected your privacy please respect mine
12-11 07:45 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hello folks
12-11 07:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm sorry for bringing stuff to this hangout last night.  I was and am pretty stunned and scared by the actions of other agents last night
12-11 07:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I do realize this is not the forum for that and apologize if I've made anyone feel uncomfortable here
12-11 07:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I really do just want to play the game and not have any strife and hope you all know that
12-11 08:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Speaking of which,  justin I tried several times to drop all my capsules and pick them back up to see if those 80 axa came back but they did not
12-11 08:24 <Justin Kominar> That sucks :(  I'm so sorry that happened.  They didn't show up for me either.
12-11 08:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah was gonna ask
12-11 08:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Freakin bummer but will see if Niantic can help
12-11 08:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> If it was another agent they might be able to tell me that
12-11 08:31 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Or if it was just a game bug maybe I can get them back
12-11 10:11 <Justin Kominar> I suspect if they haven't returned by now, they'd lost.
12-11 10:11 <Justin Kominar> they're...
12-11 10:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah but maybe they can find a way to give them back to me, or if it was an agent I would think they could tell me that
12-11 10:32 <Christy King> At least you were giving them away so you were ready to not have them, and Justin didn't have them before, so he wasn't any worse off. Would have been even worse if you dropped to resort your capsules with intent to keep.
12-11 10:32 <Christy King> (It's not much of a silver lining, but it's something)
12-11 10:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah and I was able to give him 15 at least
12-11 10:46 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Better than nothing
12-11 10:47 <Justin Kominar> 14... and they will go to good use... and if they don't somehow get used up, I'll dutifully return them to you in exchange for my capsule  ☺
12-11 10:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah 14
12-11 10:47 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin I'm a little worried about returning that capsule to you
12-11 10:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> What if the same thing happens
12-11 10:48 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> We should make that exchange carefully
12-11 10:48 <Justin Kominar> Yeah, for sure.
12-11 10:48 <Justin Kominar> It'd suck, because there's lots of vrare stuff in there, but whatever.. it's just a game.  I'll rebuild.
12-11 10:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah
12-11 10:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I'm trying to not be too upset about 80 axa gone
12-11 10:49 <Justin Kominar> I still maintain your capsules were past their best-before date... and mine was fresh  :P   That gear is in one of my capsules, not yours ... so I have faith in the ingress gods that it'll be ok
12-11 10:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's just a game and a free one at that
12-11 10:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-11 10:49 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Capsules don't expire!  Cmon now! :-)
12-11 10:50 <Justin Kominar> No ... the just get ... rusty  ;)
12-11 10:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Silly
12-11 10:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But some silly is a great thing this am, thank you
12-11 10:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I actually giggled
12-11 10:53 <Justin Kominar> 👍
12-11 11:13 <Christy King> Maybe the capsule had a hole in it.
12-11 11:16 <Justin Kominar> If only AXA insurance co., had a policy that covered accidental loss of ingress gear...
12-11 11:18 <Christy King> Sounds more like ACME insurance co. (Meep meep!)
12-11 11:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So, interestingly enough
12-11 11:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I've been getting some other unable to use errors trying to put keys in capsules today
12-11 11:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Nothing flat out vanishing though
12-11 11:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Haha holy capsule!
12-11 11:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Blessed by jeeeeebus
12-11 12:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Looks like I've got possible incoming smurf
12-11 12:19 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Usual suspects
12-11 12:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Simple coincidence
12-11 12:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Was able to field right over said smurf
12-11 12:29 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-11 12:32 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> But I do have a job, and one that requires me to, yknow, actually do stuff, so will see about moar fields later
12-11 12:40 <Justin Kominar> He hasn't touched my home portal all week long... so clearly he's in conservation mode for tomorrow.  This is a great time to do it.
12-11 12:40 <Justin Kominar> Plus, I popped his couch-8 last night  ;)
12-11 13:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well this is unfortunate
12-11 13:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Seems all the cute little lizards at Edith Morley park are gone
12-11 13:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I think the birds ate them all
12-11 13:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> That or smurfs!
12-11 13:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No smurf in particular mind you
12-11 13:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Just whatever ones come here
12-11 13:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Grumpy smurf
12-11 13:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Psycho smurf
12-11 13:24 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> All smurfs
12-11 13:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Villainous traitor smurf
12-11 13:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-11 13:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Probably just birds
12-11 13:33 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn birds
12-11 13:33 <Justin Kominar> Smurfs only eat smurfberries, if I recall my early childhood studies correctly.
12-11 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I thought that was their power source
12-11 13:35 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So they can have smurf lights and such
12-11 13:36 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Maybe I'm thinking of unobtainium
12-11 13:38 <Justin Kominar> http://smurfs.wikia.com/wiki/Smurfberry
12-11 13:38 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-11 13:38 <Justin Kominar> Wikis don't lie
12-11 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Haha this one friend of mine calls Wikipedia  "collective hunch"
12-11 13:42 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> :-)
12-11 15:45 <Christy King> Lizards are probably hiding it's cold out and they need sunlight for the energy to move much.
12-11 15:46 <Justin Kominar> Maybe chinchillas are just lizards in disguise?!?
12-11 16:03 <Christy King> Nah, they LOVE the cold. They have a thick fluffy coat all ready to go. 😊
12-11 16:07 <Justin Kominar> Well that's my point ... maybe they're just lizards in fur coats
12-11 16:57 <Christy King> Hahaha
12-11 18:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Lol
12-11 18:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I love lizards a whole lot
12-11 18:17 <Justin Kominar> Can anyone take out he chameleon power box?  Seeker's got himself another P8 there

12-11 20:52 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yay fields
12-11 20:53 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Los Gatos creek trail looking better
12-11 23:33 <Lance Fanger> Snowpup thanks for buffing my couch portals
12-12 07:50 <Maria la Gorda> Good luck at the anomaly! I'm cheering for you! ❤️🐸
12-12 09:02 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Same here

12-12 09:45 <Maria la Gorda> Yup, in DC metro area already... It's unsualkt warm and I'm sweating bullets because I brought winter cloth.
12-12 09:46 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-12 09:46 <Maria la Gorda> Me waiting to board yesterday 
12-12 09:53 <Josh Lehan> Cool, get uniques while you are traveling
12-12 09:55 <Maria la Gorda> Definetly.... except that I was so busy looking at renting ads on Craigslist during my lay over & waiting for my luggages that I forget to get uniques 😯
12-12 10:17 <Maria la Gorda> LOL I must be the room that has made the most front desk calls. 
12-12 12:18 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-12 15:12 <Josh Lehan> Seeker encountered at Measurement 3 
12-12 15:12 <Josh Lehan> They won but it took 27 agents to our 6 
12-12 15:13 <Josh Lehan> Golden Dragon portal 
12-12 15:14 <Christy King> WOW!
12-12 15:14 <Josh Lehan> Gave him 400 bursters and 100 ultra strikes 
12-12 15:14 <Christy King> Here is our view. 😊
12-12 15:14 <Christy King> ###
12-12 15:15 <Josh Lehan> So in other words it was just another night at the JCC :) 
12-12 15:39 <Justin Kominar> I was standing next to him in registration line this morning, but he didn't recognize me.
12-12 17:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Does this go on tomorrow too?
12-12 17:29 <Josh Lehan> Mission day - won't be here for it though 
12-12 17:29 <Christy King> ###
12-12 17:29 <Josh Lehan> Grats 
12-12 17:57 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yeah grats
12-12 18:14 <Maria la Gorda> ###
12-12 18:17 <Christy King> Thanks!!!!
12-12 18:20 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Christy did you go to anomaly
12-12 18:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't field today, ate some pills that were supposed to make my back not hurt but they made me feel sick too
12-12 18:23 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> So I just laid down
12-12 18:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Doh, wrong chat window,  sorry
12-12 18:25 <Christy King> Sort of
12-12 18:25 <Christy King> We went to a lighthouse to keep it green
12-12 18:25 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Wasn't meant for you folks
12-12 18:25 <Christy King> But not in Oakland
12-12 18:25 <Christy King> Fielding team
12-12 18:26 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cool
12-12 18:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hope you had a nice day
12-12 18:27 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Cheers
12-12 18:28 <Christy King> How was LG? Make some good fields?
12-12 18:28 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> No, sorry
12-12 18:28 <Christy King> No worries!
12-12 18:30 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Have a nice night
12-12 20:13 <Eric Sphoo> ###
12-12 20:14 <Eric Sphoo> That was shortly after the end haha 
12-12 20:20 <Christy King> Holy moly!!!
12-12 20:22 <Maria la Gorda> Who dropped the keys?
12-12 20:29 <Christy King> Recycling keys is worth way more xm now. Was 20, now 500.
12-12 21:01 <Josh Lehan> Seeker yelled at me and really lost his temper today at Measurement 3, some people had to pull us apart 
12-12 21:01 <Josh Lehan> Now more agents know what a jerk he is 
12-12 21:03 <Josh Lehan> Part of me wants to get more keys from Golden Dragon portal, where it was, and drop them at JCC 
12-12 22:05 <Paula E> That's awesome on the recycling of the keys. When did it go from 200 to 500? Is it for a limited time?
12-12 22:20 <Maria la Gorda> thx for the tip Christy!
12-12 22:21 <Josh Lehan> Keys give 500 mana now, which is half of a L1 cube! 
12-12 22:27 <Maria la Gorda> it's for this WE only though
12-12 22:31 <Paula E> Thanks, then will it remain at 200?
12-12 22:33 <Maria la Gorda> i thing so https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/PtrsetjvDyi
12-12 23:06 <Christy King> It wasn't even 200 before, it was 20!
12-12 23:06 <Christy King> Brian noticed the 500 early last week, but I'm not sure when it started
12-12 23:08 <Christy King> I hope it doesn't go back. I thought they were doing a Key Hoarding Crisis Intervention... ^_^;;
12-13 01:39 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Sounds like yall mostly had a great time, that's good to hear
12-13 10:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Justin apparently other people have been having capsule problems too
12-13 10:43 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I didn't write to Niantic about it yet
12-13 14:15 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Well I got an abbadon badge in any case, for donations of axa, woo
12-13 15:05 <Justin Kominar> Oh awesome
12-13 15:05 <Justin Kominar> I have your gear to return.  Didn't end up using it, we dominated so hard...
12-13 15:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Keep it
12-13 15:09 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Deploy it at will
12-13 15:10 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> I still have your gear
12-13 15:11 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Damn it's pouring
12-13 15:12 <Justin Kominar> You should have those AXA back to capsule and grow for next time.  Seriously I have lots left over.  Happy to return them with interest.
12-13 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Not today in any case
12-13 15:12 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Too pouring
12-13 15:13 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Had to come back inside

12-14 10:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Oh its xm not ap
12-14 10:22 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Hm
12-14 12:46 <Christy King> I hope it stays at 500xm! But I just did some key clearing as well, just in case it doesnt. And then used the xm to recharge others! :)
12-14 12:59 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Yah been doing the same
12-14 13:00 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Plus do I really need all these saratoga keys

12-14 13:04 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> It's not even an area I'm likely to visit again,  maybe in some number of months but why hold on to keys that long
12-14 13:16 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Gonna have to go take out some of those rp8 portals on the trail soon

12-14 13:18 <fuckoffadric idontgiveafuck> Should be an easy smash
